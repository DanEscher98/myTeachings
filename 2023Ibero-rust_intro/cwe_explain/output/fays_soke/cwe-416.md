# CWE-416: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-416 is a common programming mistake that occurs when a programmer allocates insufficient memory 
for a buffer, leading to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. In this article, we will discuss how C17, 
C++20, and Rust handle this issue idiomatically.

## C17

C17 does not provide any built-in protection against buffer overflow vulnerabilities. However, 
programmers can use the `strncpy()` function to copy a string to a buffer with a specified size. 
This function ensures that the buffer is not overflowed.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    char* str = "Hello, world!";
    strncpy(buffer, str, sizeof(buffer));
    buffer[sizeof(buffer) - 1] = '\0';
    printf("%s\n", buffer);
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we declare a buffer of size 10 and copy a string to it using `strncpy()`. We also 
ensure that the buffer is null-terminated by setting the last character to `'\0'`.

## C++20

C++20 provides the `std::span` class, which represents a view over a contiguous sequence of 
objects. This class can be used to prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities by providing a safe way 
to access elements in a buffer.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <span>

int main() {
    int buffer[10];
    std::span<int> span(buffer, 10);
    for (int i = 0; i < span.size(); i++) {
        span[i] = i;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < span.size(); i++) {
        std::cout << span[i] << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we declare a buffer of size 10 and create a `std::span` object that represents the 
buffer. We then use a loop to set the values of the elements in the buffer and another loop to 
print the values.

## Rust

Rust provides built-in protection against buffer overflow vulnerabilities through its ownership and 
borrowing system. Rust ensures that a buffer cannot be accessed out of bounds by checking the 
bounds at runtime.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut buffer = [0; 10];
    for i in 0..buffer.len() {
        buffer[i] = i as i32;
    }
    for i in 0..buffer.len() {
        println!("{}", buffer[i]);
    }
}
```

In this example, we declare a buffer of size 10 and use a loop to set the values of the elements in 
the buffer. Rust ensures that the loop does not access elements out of bounds by checking the 
bounds at runtime.

## Conclusion

C17, C++20, and Rust all provide ways to prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities. C17 and C++20 
rely on functions and classes to ensure that buffers are not overflowed, while Rust uses its 
ownership and borrowing system to check the bounds of buffers at runtime. Programmers should choose 
the language and approach that best fits their needs and requirements.
