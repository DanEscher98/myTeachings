# CWE-762: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-762 is a vulnerability that occurs when a program uses a pointer to a freed memory location. 
This can lead to undefined behavior, including crashes, data corruption, and security 
vulnerabilities.

## C17

In C17, there is no built-in protection against CWE-762. Programmers must manually manage memory 
allocation and deallocation, which can be error-prone and difficult to debug.

### Idiomatic Example

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int* ptr = malloc(sizeof(int));
    *ptr = 42;
    free(ptr);
    *ptr = 0; // CWE-762: use after free
    return 0;
}
```

This code allocates memory for an integer, sets its value to 42, frees the memory, and then 
attempts to access the freed memory. This results in undefined behavior.

## C++20

In C++20, the new smart pointer classes provide automatic memory management and protection against 
CWE-762. `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr` automatically free memory when they go out of 
scope, and prevent access to freed memory.

### Idiomatic Example

```cpp
#include <memory>

int main() {
    std::unique_ptr<int> ptr = std::make_unique<int>(42);
    ptr.reset(); // frees memory
    *ptr = 0; // compilation error: use after free
    return 0;
}
```

This code uses `std::unique_ptr` to allocate memory for an integer, set its value to 42, and then 
free the memory. Attempting to access the freed memory results in a compilation error.

## Rust

In Rust, the ownership and borrowing system provides automatic memory management and protection 
against CWE-762. When a value is moved or borrowed, Rust ensures that it is not used after it has 
been freed.

### Idiomatic Example

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut ptr = Box::new(42);
    ptr = Box::new(0); // frees memory and allocates new memory
    *ptr = 0; // compilation error: use after free
}
```

This code uses `Box` to allocate memory for an integer, set its value to 42, and then free the 
memory by assigning a new value to `ptr`. Attempting to access the freed memory results in a 
compilation error.

## Conclusion

C17 provides no built-in protection against CWE-762, while C++20 and Rust provide automatic memory 
management and protection against use after free. While C++20 and Rust have similar features, 
Rust's ownership and borrowing system provides stronger guarantees and can prevent other types of 
memory-related vulnerabilities.
