# CWE-502: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-502 is a weakness that occurs when a function does not properly restrict the size of an input, 
leading to a buffer overflow. In this article, we will discuss how C17, C++20, and Rust handle this 
weakness idiomatically.

## C17

C17 does not provide any built-in protection against CWE-502. However, there are some coding 
patterns that can be used to mitigate the risk of buffer overflow. One such pattern is to use the 
`fgets()` function instead of `gets()`. The `fgets()` function takes an additional argument that 
specifies the maximum number of characters to read, preventing buffer overflow.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    fgets(buffer, 10, stdin); // read up to 9 characters
    printf("%s", buffer);
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we declare a buffer of size 10 and use `fgets()` to read up to 9 characters from 
standard input. The `printf()` function is used to print the contents of the buffer.

## C++20

C++20 provides several features that can be used to mitigate the risk of buffer overflow. One such 
feature is the `std::string` class, which automatically manages the size of the buffer and prevents 
buffer overflow.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string buffer;
    std::getline(std::cin, buffer); // read a line of text
    std::cout << buffer << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we declare a `std::string` object and use `std::getline()` to read a line of text 
from standard input. The `std::cout` object is used to print the contents of the buffer.

## Rust

Rust provides several features that can be used to prevent buffer overflow. One such feature is the 
`String` type, which automatically manages the size of the buffer and prevents buffer overflow.

```rust
use std::io::{self, BufRead};

fn main() {
    let stdin = io::stdin();
    let mut buffer = String::new();
    stdin.lock().read_line(&mut buffer).unwrap(); // read a line of text
    println!("{}", buffer);
}
```

In this example, we declare a `String` object and use `stdin.lock().read_line()` to read a line of 
text from standard input. The `println!()` macro is used to print the contents of the buffer.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, C17 provides some coding patterns that can be used to mitigate the risk of buffer 
overflow, while C++20 and Rust provide built-in features that automatically manage the size of the 
buffer and prevent buffer overflow. It is important to use these features and patterns to ensure 
the security and correctness of our code.
