# CWE-122: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-122 is a common weakness in software development that involves the use of an index to access an 
array or a pointer to access a memory location without proper bounds checking. This can lead to 
buffer overflows, which can be exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code or crash the 
program.

## C17

In C17, there is no built-in protection against buffer overflows. Programmers must manually check 
the bounds of arrays and pointers to ensure that they do not exceed their allocated size. This can 
be error-prone and time-consuming, especially in large codebases.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    int index = 15;
    if (index < 10) {
        buffer[index] = 'A';
    }
    printf("%c\n", buffer[index]);
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the program attempts to write the character 'A' to an index of the buffer that is 
out of bounds. However, since there is no bounds checking, the program does not crash and instead 
prints whatever value happens to be in memory at that location.

## C++20

In C++20, the standard library includes the `std::span` class, which provides a safe and efficient 
way to work with arrays and pointers. A `span` is a view into a contiguous sequence of objects, and 
it includes information about the size of the sequence.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <span>

int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    std::span<char> span(buffer);
    int index = 15;
    if (index < span.size()) {
        span[index] = 'A';
    }
    std::cout << span[index] << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the program creates a `span` object that points to the `buffer` array. The program 
then checks the bounds of the `span` object before attempting to write to it. If the index is out 
of bounds, the program will throw an exception and terminate.

## Rust

In Rust, the language includes a number of features that make it difficult to write code that is 
vulnerable to buffer overflows. One of these features is the ownership system, which ensures that 
each piece of memory has a single owner and that the owner is responsible for managing the memory.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut buffer = [0u8; 10];
    let index = 15;
    if index < buffer.len() {
        buffer[index] = b'A';
    }
    println!("{}", buffer[index]);
}
```

In this example, the program creates a mutable array `buffer` with a length of 10. The program then 
checks the bounds of the array before attempting to write to it. If the index is out of bounds, the 
program will panic and terminate.

Another feature of Rust that helps prevent buffer overflows is the use of iterators instead of raw 
loops. Iterators automatically check the bounds of arrays and prevent buffer overflows.

## Conclusion

C17 provides no built-in protection against buffer overflows, and programmers must manually check 
the bounds of arrays and pointers. C++20 includes the `std::span` class, which provides a safe and 
efficient way to work with arrays and pointers. Rust includes a number of features, such as the 
ownership system and iterators, that make it difficult to write code that is vulnerable to buffer 
overflows.
