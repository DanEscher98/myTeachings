# CWE-401: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-401 is a common weakness in software development that involves the use of a function or feature 
that is known to be unsafe or prone to errors. This can lead to vulnerabilities in the software 
that can be exploited by attackers. In this article, we will compare how C17, C++20, and Rust 
handle the CWE-401 idiomatically.

## C17

C17 is a programming language that is widely used in system programming and embedded systems. It is 
a low-level language that provides direct access to hardware resources, making it a popular choice 
for developing operating systems and device drivers. However, C17 is also known for its lack of 
safety features, which can make it vulnerable to CWE-401.

In C17, the CWE-401 idiomatically can be handled by using safe programming practices such as bounds 
checking and input validation. However, these practices can be tedious and error-prone, especially 
in large codebases.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    printf("Enter your name: ");
    fgets(buffer, 10, stdin);
    buffer[strcspn(buffer, "\n")] = 0;
    printf("Hello, %s!\n", buffer);
    return 0;
}
```

This example shows how to handle user input safely in C17. The `fgets` function is used to read 
input from the user, and the `strcspn` function is used to remove any newline characters from the 
input. This ensures that the input is properly formatted and does not contain any unexpected 
characters.

## C++20

C++20 is the latest version of the C++ programming language, which is known for its powerful 
features and performance. C++20 includes several new features that make it easier to write safe and 
secure code, including modules, concepts, and ranges.

In C++20, the CWE-401 idiomatically can be handled by using modern features such as smart pointers 
and range-based for loops. Smart pointers provide automatic memory management, which can help 
prevent memory leaks and other memory-related vulnerabilities. Range-based for loops provide a 
safer and more concise way to iterate over collections, which can help prevent buffer overflows and 
other vulnerabilities.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::vector<std::unique_ptr<int>> numbers;
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        numbers.push_back(std::make_unique<int>(i));
    }
    for (const auto& number : numbers) {
        std::cout << *number << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This example shows how to use smart pointers and range-based for loops in C++20. The 
`std::unique_ptr` class is used to manage memory for the `int` objects, and the `std::vector` class 
is used to store the pointers. The range-based for loop is used to iterate over the vector and 
print the values.

## Rust

Rust is a modern systems programming language that is designed to be safe and secure by default. 
Rust includes several features that make it easier to write safe and secure code, including 
ownership and borrowing, lifetimes, and the borrow checker.

In Rust, the CWE-401 idiomatically can be handled by using ownership and borrowing to ensure that 
memory is managed safely and securely. Ownership ensures that each value has a unique owner, which 
prevents multiple threads from accessing the same memory at the same time. Borrowing allows 
multiple threads to access the same memory, but only one thread can modify it at a time.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut numbers = Vec::new();
    for i in 0..10 {
        numbers.push(i);
    }
    for number in &numbers {
        println!("{}", number);
    }
}
```

This example shows how to use ownership and borrowing in Rust. The `Vec` class is used to store the 
`i32` values, and the `&` operator is used to borrow the vector for the range-based for loop. This 
ensures that the vector is not modified while it is being iterated over.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, C17, C++20, and Rust all provide ways to handle the CWE-401 idiomatically. However, 
each language has its own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to safety and security. C17 
requires safe programming practices to handle the CWE-401 idiomatically, while C++20 and Rust 
provide modern features that make it easier to write safe and secure code. Rust is particularly 
strong in this area, thanks to its ownership and borrowing system, which ensures that memory is 
managed safely and securely.
