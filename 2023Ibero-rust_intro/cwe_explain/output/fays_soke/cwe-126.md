# CWE-126: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-126 is a vulnerability that occurs when a program uses a buffer or stack allocation without 
proper bounds checking, leading to buffer overflow or stack overflow. In this article, we will 
discuss how C17, C++20, and Rust handle this vulnerability idiomatically.

## C17

C17 does not provide any built-in protection against CWE-126. However, it is possible to mitigate 
the vulnerability by using safe coding practices such as bounds checking and input validation.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    printf("Enter your name: ");
    fgets(buffer, 10, stdin);
    buffer[strcspn(buffer, "\n")] = 0; // remove newline character
    printf("Hello, %s!\n", buffer);
    return 0;
}
```

In the above example, we use `fgets` to read input from the user and limit the input to 10 
characters. We also remove the newline character from the input using `strcspn`. This ensures that 
the buffer is not overflowed.

## C++20

C++20 provides several built-in protections against CWE-126, including `std::span` and 
`std::string_view`. `std::span` is a non-owning view of a contiguous sequence of objects, while 
`std::string_view` is a non-owning view of a sequence of characters.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <span>

int main() {
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    std::span<int> s(arr, 5);
    std::cout << s[2] << std::endl; // prints 3
    return 0;
}
```

In the above example, we use `std::span` to create a view of an array of integers. We can access 
the elements of the array using the `[]` operator, and bounds checking is performed automatically.

## Rust

Rust provides built-in protection against CWE-126 through its ownership and borrowing system. Rust 
ensures that each value has a unique owner, and borrows can be used to access the value without 
transferring ownership.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let slice = &mut v[1..4];
    slice[0] = 0;
    println!("{:?}", v); // prints [1, 0, 4, 5, 6]
}
```

In the above example, we use a mutable borrow to modify a slice of a vector. Rust ensures that the 
slice is within the bounds of the vector, and bounds checking is performed automatically.

## Conclusion

C17 does not provide any built-in protection against CWE-126, but safe coding practices can be used 
to mitigate the vulnerability. C++20 provides built-in protections through `std::span` and 
`std::string_view`, while Rust provides built-in protection through its ownership and borrowing 
system. It is important to use the appropriate language features to mitigate CWE-126 and other 
vulnerabilities.
