# CWE-676: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-676 refers to the use of potentially dangerous functions such as `strcpy` and `strcat` in C and 
C++ programming languages. These functions do not perform bounds checking, which can lead to buffer 
overflows and other security vulnerabilities. Rust, on the other hand, has a strong focus on memory 
safety and provides safer alternatives to these functions.

## C17

In C17, the CWE-676 can be mitigated by using the `strncpy` and `strncat` functions instead of 
`strcpy` and `strcat`. These functions take an additional argument specifying the maximum number of 
characters to copy or concatenate, preventing buffer overflows. However, these functions can still 
be dangerous if the maximum length is not properly calculated.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char src[10] = "hello";
    char dest[10] = "world";
    size_t max_len = sizeof(dest) - strlen(dest) - 1; // calculate maximum length
    strncat(dest, src, max_len); // concatenate with maximum length
    printf("%s\n", dest);
    return 0;
}
```

## C++20

In C++20, the CWE-676 can be mitigated by using the `std::string` class instead of C-style strings. 
`std::string` provides bounds checking and automatically manages memory allocation, making it safer 
and easier to use than C-style strings.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string src = "hello";
    std::string dest = "world";
    dest.append(src); // concatenate using std::string methods
    std::cout << dest << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Rust

In Rust, the CWE-676 is eradicated by using the `String` type instead of C-style strings. `String` 
is a growable, UTF-8 encoded string type that provides bounds checking and automatic memory 
management. Rust also provides the `str::to_string` method to convert C-style strings to `String`.

```rust
fn main() {
    let src = "hello";
    let mut dest = String::from("world");
    dest.push_str(src); // concatenate using String methods
    println!("{}", dest);
}
```

## Conclusion

While C17 and C++20 provide safer alternatives to C-style strings, they still require careful 
calculation of maximum lengths and can be error-prone. Rust's focus on memory safety and automatic 
memory management makes it the safest choice for handling strings and mitigating CWE-676.
