# CWE-121: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-121 is a weakness related to stack-based buffer overflow. It occurs when a program writes to a 
buffer that is located on the stack and exceeds the buffer's boundary. This can lead to memory 
corruption, which can be exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code or crash the program.

## C17

In C17, buffer overflow vulnerabilities are a common problem. The language does not provide any 
built-in protection against buffer overflows, and programmers must manually ensure that their code 
does not write beyond the boundaries of a buffer.

### Example

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    strcpy(buffer, "Hello, world!");
    printf("%s\n", buffer);
    return 0;
}
```

This code copies a string that is longer than the buffer into the buffer using `strcpy()`. This 
results in a buffer overflow, which can cause undefined behavior.

## C++20

C++20 provides several features that can help mitigate buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The 
language provides bounds-checked arrays, which are arrays that automatically check that all 
accesses are within the bounds of the array.

### Example

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <array>

int main() {
    std::array<char, 10> buffer;
    std::string str = "Hello, world!";
    std::copy_n(str.begin(), buffer.size(), buffer.begin());
    std::cout << buffer.data() << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This code uses a `std::array` to create a buffer of size 10. The `std::copy_n()` function is used 
to copy the string into the buffer, ensuring that no more than 10 characters are copied. This 
prevents a buffer overflow from occurring.

## Rust

Rust provides several features that can help prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The language 
provides a safe and efficient memory management system that prevents buffer overflows and other 
memory-related vulnerabilities.

### Example

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut buffer: [u8; 10] = [0; 10];
    let str = "Hello, world!";
    buffer[..str.len()].copy_from_slice(str.as_bytes());
    println!("{}", std::str::from_utf8(&buffer).unwrap());
}
```

This code creates a buffer of size 10 using an array. The `copy_from_slice()` method is used to 
copy the string into the buffer, ensuring that no more than 10 characters are copied. This prevents 
a buffer overflow from occurring.

## Conclusion

C17 does not provide any built-in protection against buffer overflow vulnerabilities, and 
programmers must manually ensure that their code does not write beyond the boundaries of a buffer. 
C++20 provides bounds-checked arrays, which can help mitigate buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Rust 
provides a safe and efficient memory management system that prevents buffer overflows and other 
memory-related vulnerabilities.
