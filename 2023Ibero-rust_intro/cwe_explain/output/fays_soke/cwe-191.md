# CWE-191: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-191 is a Common Weakness Enumeration that refers to the use of pointer arithmetic to access 
memory locations outside the bounds of an array. This can lead to buffer overflows, which can cause 
security vulnerabilities and crashes.

## C17

In C17, there are no built-in mechanisms to prevent buffer overflows. Programmers must manually 
check the bounds of arrays and ensure that they do not access memory outside of the array. This can 
be error-prone and time-consuming, especially for large and complex programs.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int *ptr = arr;
    int i;

    for (i = 0; i < 6; i++) { // accessing memory outside of the array
        printf("%d ", *(ptr + i));
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the program accesses memory outside of the `arr` array by iterating over the `ptr` 
pointer and adding an offset of `i`. This can cause undefined behavior and potentially crash the 
program.

## C++20

In C++20, the `std::span` class was introduced to provide a safer and more convenient way to work 
with arrays. A `std::span` is a non-owning view of a contiguous sequence of objects, such as an 
array or a `std::vector`. It provides bounds checking and range-based iteration, which can help 
prevent buffer overflows.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <span>

int main() {
    int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    std::span<int> sp(arr);

    for (auto i : sp) { // safe iteration over the span
        std::cout << i << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the program creates a `std::span` object from the `arr` array and iterates over it 
using a range-based `for` loop. The `std::span` class ensures that the iteration stays within the 
bounds of the array, preventing buffer overflows.

## Rust

In Rust, the `Vec` type provides a safe and flexible way to work with dynamically-sized arrays. A 
`Vec` is a growable array that can be accessed using indexing or iteration. Rust's ownership and 
borrowing system ensures that the array is always accessed within its bounds, preventing buffer 
overflows.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    for i in &vec { // safe iteration over the vector
        println!("{}", i);
    }

    vec.push(6); // safe addition to the vector

    let slice = &vec[0..3]; // safe slicing of the vector

    println!("{:?}", slice);
}
```

In this example, the program creates a `Vec` object from a list of integers and iterates over it 
using a reference to the vector. The `Vec` type ensures that the iteration stays within the bounds 
of the vector, preventing buffer overflows. The program also demonstrates safe addition to the 
vector and safe slicing of the vector using indexing.

## Conclusion

C17 provides no built-in mechanisms to prevent buffer overflows, making it error-prone and 
time-consuming for programmers to manually check the bounds of arrays. C++20 introduces the 
`std::span` class, which provides bounds checking and range-based iteration to prevent buffer 
overflows. Rust's ownership and borrowing system ensures that arrays are always accessed within 
their bounds, preventing buffer overflows and providing a safe and flexible way to work with 
dynamically-sized arrays.
