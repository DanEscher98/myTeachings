# CWE-191: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-191 is a common weakness in software development that involves the use of a pointer to a freed 
memory location. This can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, and security vulnerabilities. In 
this article, we will compare how C17, C++20, and Rust handle this issue idiomatically.

## C17

C17 does not provide any built-in mechanisms to prevent CWE-191. However, modern compilers can 
detect some instances of this issue and warn the developer. To mitigate this weakness, C17 
developers can use manual memory management techniques, such as tracking the lifetime of pointers 
and setting them to NULL after freeing them.

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int* ptr = malloc(sizeof(int));
    *ptr = 42;
    free(ptr);
    ptr = NULL; // set pointer to NULL after freeing
    return 0;
}
```

## C++20

C++20 introduces the smart pointer concept, which is a type of object that behaves like a pointer 
but provides automatic memory management. Smart pointers can detect when a pointer is no longer 
needed and automatically free the memory. This feature helps to prevent CWE-191 and other 
memory-related issues.

```c++
#include <memory>

int main() {
    std::unique_ptr<int> ptr = std::make_unique<int>(42);
    ptr.reset(); // automatically frees memory
    return 0;
}
```

## Rust

Rust is a memory-safe language that prevents CWE-191 and other memory-related issues through its 
ownership and borrowing system. In Rust, each value has a unique owner, and ownership can be 
transferred between variables. When a value goes out of scope, Rust automatically frees the memory. 
This feature eliminates the need for manual memory management and prevents CWE-191.

```rust
fn main() {
    let ptr = Box::new(42);
    // ownership of ptr is transferred to ptr2
    let ptr2 = ptr;
    // ptr is no longer valid
}
```

## Conclusion

C17, C++20, and Rust handle CWE-191 in different ways. C17 relies on manual memory management 
techniques, while C++20 introduces smart pointers to automate memory management. Rust, on the other 
hand, prevents CWE-191 and other memory-related issues through its ownership and borrowing system. 
Developers should choose the language that best fits their needs and expertise, taking into account 
the strengths and weaknesses of each language.
