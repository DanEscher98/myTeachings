# CWE-120: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-120 is a weakness related to buffer overflow. It occurs when a program writes data to a buffer 
without checking if the buffer is large enough to hold the data. This can lead to memory 
corruption, which can be exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code.

## C17

In C17, buffer overflow is a common problem due to the lack of built-in safety features. However, 
there are some idiomatic ways to mitigate this issue.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    char input[20];
    fgets(input, 20, stdin);
    strncpy(buffer, input, 10);
    buffer[9] = '\0';
    printf("%s\n", buffer);
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we use `strncpy` to copy the input string to the buffer. We also add a null 
terminator to the end of the buffer to ensure that it is properly terminated. This approach is not 
foolproof, as it relies on the programmer to correctly specify the buffer size and null terminator. 
It is also prone to off-by-one errors.

## C++20

In C++20, there are several built-in safety features that can help mitigate buffer overflow.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string buffer;
    std::cin >> buffer;
    std::cout << buffer.substr(0, 9) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we use a `std::string` object to store the input. We then use the `substr` method 
to extract the first 10 characters of the string. This approach is much safer than the C17 example, 
as it automatically handles memory allocation and null termination. It is also less prone to 
off-by-one errors.

## Rust

In Rust, buffer overflow is prevented by the ownership and borrowing system. Rust ensures that each 
variable has a single owner, and that ownership can be transferred or borrowed as needed.

```rust
use std::io::{self, BufRead};

fn main() {
    let stdin = io::stdin();
    let mut buffer = String::new();
    stdin.lock().read_line(&mut buffer).unwrap();
    println!("{}", &buffer[0..9]);
}
```

In this example, we use a `String` object to store the input. We then use the `&` operator to 
borrow a slice of the string containing the first 10 characters. This approach is very safe, as 
Rust ensures that the borrowed slice is always within the bounds of the original string. It is also 
very efficient, as Rust avoids unnecessary memory allocations.

## Conclusion

In summary, C17 is the least safe of the three languages, as it lacks built-in safety features. 
C++20 is much safer, as it provides a `std::string` class that automatically handles memory 
allocation and null termination. Rust is the safest of the three, as it prevents buffer overflow 
through its ownership and borrowing system. However, it is important to note that all three 
languages can be used safely if the programmer is careful and follows best practices.
