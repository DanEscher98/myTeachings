# CWE-476: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-476 is a common programming mistake that occurs when a program allocates memory without 
checking if the allocation was successful. This can lead to a variety of issues, including crashes, 
memory leaks, and security vulnerabilities.

## C17

In C17, the most common way to allocate memory is to use the `malloc` function. However, this 
function does not provide any guarantees that the allocation will be successful. To handle this, 
C17 programmers typically check the return value of `malloc` to ensure that the allocation was 
successful before using the allocated memory.

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int* ptr = malloc(sizeof(int));
    if (ptr == NULL) {
        // handle error
    }
    // use ptr
    free(ptr);
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we allocate memory for an integer using `malloc`. We then check if the allocation 
was successful by comparing the return value of `malloc` to `NULL`. If the allocation was 
successful, we can use the allocated memory. Finally, we free the memory using the `free` function.

## C++20

In C++20, the most common way to allocate memory is to use the `new` operator. However, this 
operator also does not provide any guarantees that the allocation will be successful. To handle 
this, C++20 programmers typically use exceptions to handle allocation failures.

```cpp
#include <new>

int main() {
    try {
        int* ptr = new int;
        // use ptr
        delete ptr;
    } catch (std::bad_alloc& e) {
        // handle error
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we allocate memory for an integer using the `new` operator. If the allocation 
fails, a `std::bad_alloc` exception is thrown. We catch this exception and handle the error 
appropriately. If the allocation was successful, we can use the allocated memory. Finally, we free 
the memory using the `delete` operator.

## Rust

In Rust, memory allocation is handled by the language's ownership and borrowing system. When a 
value is allocated on the heap, it is wrapped in a `Box` type, which ensures that the value is 
deallocated when it goes out of scope.

```rust
fn main() {
    let ptr = Box::new(42);
    // use ptr
}
```

In this example, we allocate memory for an integer using the `Box::new` function. The resulting 
`Box` value is automatically deallocated when it goes out of scope, so there is no need to manually 
free the memory. If the allocation fails, a `std::alloc::AllocError` error is returned, which can 
be handled appropriately.

## Conclusion

All three languages provide ways to handle the CWE-476 idiomatically. In C17 and C++20, programmers 
typically check the return value of memory allocation functions or use exceptions to handle 
allocation failures. In Rust, memory allocation is handled by the language's ownership and 
borrowing system, which ensures that memory is deallocated when it goes out of scope.
