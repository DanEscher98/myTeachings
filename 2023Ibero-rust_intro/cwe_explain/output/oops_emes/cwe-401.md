# CWE-401: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-401 is a common weakness in software development that involves the use of a function or method 
that is not properly protected against buffer overflow attacks. This can lead to serious security 
vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers.

## C17

In C17, the CWE-401 can be handled by using the `strncpy()` function instead of `strcpy()`. 
`strncpy()` allows the programmer to specify the maximum number of characters to copy, which can 
prevent buffer overflows.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char src[10] = "hello";
    char dest[5];
    strncpy(dest, src, sizeof(dest));
    dest[sizeof(dest) - 1] = '\0';
    printf("%s\n", dest);
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we use `strncpy()` to copy the contents of `src` to `dest`. We specify the maximum 
number of characters to copy as the size of `dest`. We also add a null terminator to `dest` to 
ensure that it is properly terminated.

## C++20

In C++20, the CWE-401 can be handled by using the `std::string` class instead of C-style strings. 
`std::string` automatically manages memory allocation and can prevent buffer overflows.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string src = "hello";
    std::string dest = src.substr(0, 4);
    std::cout << dest << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we use `std::string` to create `src` and `dest`. We use the `substr()` method to 
copy the first four characters of `src` to `dest`. `std::string` automatically manages memory 
allocation, so we don't need to worry about buffer overflows.

## Rust

In Rust, the CWE-401 can be handled by using the `String` type instead of C-style strings. `String` 
is a growable string type that automatically manages memory allocation and can prevent buffer 
overflows.

```rust
fn main() {
    let src = String::from("hello");
    let dest = src.chars().take(4).collect::<String>();
    println!("{}", dest);
}
```

In this example, we use `String` to create `src` and `dest`. We use the `chars()` method to get an 
iterator over the characters in `src`, and then use the `take()` method to take the first four 
characters. We then use the `collect()` method to collect the characters into a new `String`. 
`String` automatically manages memory allocation, so we don't need to worry about buffer overflows.

## Conclusion

In all three languages, the CWE-401 can be handled by using modern features that automatically 
manage memory allocation and prevent buffer overflows. While C17 and C++20 require more manual 
intervention, Rust's `String` type provides a more idiomatic solution. However, it's important to 
note that all three solutions are effective and can be used depending on the specific needs of the 
project.
