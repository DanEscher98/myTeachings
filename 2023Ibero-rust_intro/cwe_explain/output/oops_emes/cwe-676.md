# CWE-676: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-676 is a security vulnerability that occurs when a program uses a potentially dangerous 
function, such as `strcpy`, `strcat`, or `sprintf`, without proper bounds checking. This can lead 
to buffer overflows and other security issues.

## C17

In C17, the standard library provides safer alternatives to the dangerous functions mentioned 
above, such as `strncpy`, `strncat`, and `snprintf`. These functions take an additional argument 
that specifies the maximum number of characters to copy or concatenate, preventing buffer overflows.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char src[] = "Hello, world!";
    char dest[5];
    strncpy(dest, src, sizeof(dest) - 1);
    dest[sizeof(dest) - 1] = '\0';
    printf("%s\n", dest);
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `strncpy` is used to copy the contents of `src` to `dest`, with a maximum length 
of `sizeof(dest) - 1`. The last character of `dest` is then set to `'\0'` to ensure it is 
null-terminated.

## C++20

In C++20, the standard library provides a range of safer alternatives to the dangerous functions 
mentioned above, such as `std::string` and `std::string_view`. These classes handle memory 
allocation and bounds checking automatically, preventing buffer overflows.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string src = "Hello, world!";
    std::string_view dest = src.substr(0, 5);
    std::cout << dest << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `std::string` is used to store the string `src`, and `std::string_view` is used to 
create a view of the first 5 characters of `src`. This view is then printed to the console.

## Rust

In Rust, the standard library provides a range of safe string handling functions, such as `String` 
and `&str`. These types handle memory allocation and bounds checking automatically, preventing 
buffer overflows.

```rust
fn main() {
    let src = "Hello, world!".to_string();
    let dest = &src[0..5];
    println!("{}", dest);
}
```

In this example, `String` is used to store the string `src`, and `&str` is used to create a 
reference to the first 5 characters of `src`. This reference is then printed to the console.

## Conclusion

All three languages provide safer alternatives to the dangerous string handling functions that can 
lead to CWE-676 vulnerabilities. C17 and C++20 provide similar solutions, with C++20 offering more 
advanced features such as `std::string_view`. Rust's approach is similar to C++20, but with a 
stronger focus on safety and memory management. Overall, it is important to use these safer 
alternatives to prevent security vulnerabilities in your code.
