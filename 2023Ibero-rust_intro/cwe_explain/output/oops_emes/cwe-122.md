# CWE-122: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-122 is a common weakness in software development that involves the use of an incorrect operator 
or expression, leading to unintended behavior or security vulnerabilities. In this article, we will 
discuss how C17, C++20, and Rust handle this issue idiomatically.

## C17

In C17, the CWE-122 idiom can be mitigated by using the `restrict` keyword, which allows the 
compiler to optimize memory access. However, this keyword is not always sufficient to prevent all 
instances of CWE-122.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a[10], b[10], *p = a, *q = b;
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        *(p + i) = i;
        *(q + i) = i * 2;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        *(p + i) += *(q + i);
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        printf("%d ", *(p + i));
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we have two arrays `a` and `b`, and we want to add their values element-wise and 
store the result in `a`. However, since `p` and `q` point to the same memory location, the result 
is incorrect. To mitigate this issue, we can use the `restrict` keyword to tell the compiler that 
`p` and `q` do not overlap:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a[10], b[10], *restrict p = a, *restrict q = b;
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        *(p + i) = i;
        *(q + i) = i * 2;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        *(p + i) += *(q + i);
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        printf("%d ", *(p + i));
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## C++20

In C++20, the CWE-122 idiom can be eradicated by using the `span` class, which provides a safe and 
efficient way to work with arrays. The `span` class is part of the C++20 standard library and can 
be used with any type of array.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <span>

int main() {
    int a[10], b[10];
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        a[i] = i;
        b[i] = i * 2;
    }
    std::span<int, 10> p(a), q(b);
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        p[i] += q[i];
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        std::cout << p[i] << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we create two arrays `a` and `b`, and we use the `span` class to create two views 
`p` and `q` of these arrays. We then add their values element-wise and store the result in `p`. 
Since `p` and `q` are views of different arrays, there is no risk of CWE-122.

## Rust

In Rust, the CWE-122 idiom can be eradicated by using the ownership and borrowing system, which 
ensures that memory is accessed safely and efficiently. Rust's ownership and borrowing system is 
based on the concept of ownership, which means that each value in Rust has a unique owner.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut a = [0; 10];
    let mut b = [0; 10];
    for i in 0..10 {
        a[i] = i;
        b[i] = i * 2;
    }
    let mut p = &mut a[..];
    let q = &b[..];
    for i in 0..10 {
        p[i] += q[i];
    }
    println!("{:?}", p);
}
```

In this example, we create two arrays `a` and `b`, and we use references `p` and `q` to these 
arrays. We then add their values element-wise and store the result in `p`. Since `p` and `q` are 
references to different arrays, there is no risk of CWE-122. Rust's ownership and borrowing system 
ensures that `p` has exclusive ownership of `a`, and that `q` is only borrowed temporarily.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, CWE-122 can be mitigated in C17 by using the `restrict` keyword, eradicated in C++20 
by using the `span` class, and eradicated in Rust by using the ownership and borrowing system. Each 
language has its own way of handling this issue idiomatically, but all three solutions ensure safe 
and efficient memory access.
