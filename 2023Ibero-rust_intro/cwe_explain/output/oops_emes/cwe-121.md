# CWE-121: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-121 is a security vulnerability that occurs when a program uses a fixed-size buffer to store 
data without performing bounds checking. This can lead to buffer overflow attacks, where an 
attacker can overwrite adjacent memory locations with malicious code.

## C17

In C17, the standard library provides functions like `strcpy` and `strcat` that do not perform 
bounds checking. To mitigate CWE-121, C17 programmers must manually check the size of the buffer 
before copying data into it.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    char input[20] = "This is a test";

    if (strlen(input) < sizeof(buffer)) {
        strcpy(buffer, input);
    } else {
        printf("Input too long\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we check the length of the input string before copying it into the buffer. If the 
input is too long, we print an error message instead of copying the data.

## C++20

In C++20, the standard library provides a safer alternative to C-style strings with the 
`std::string` class. `std::string` automatically manages memory allocation and bounds checking, 
making it less prone to CWE-121 vulnerabilities.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string buffer;
    std::string input = "This is a test";

    buffer = input;

    std::cout << buffer << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we use `std::string` to manage the buffer and input strings. The `=` operator 
automatically copies the input string into the buffer, and `std::string` handles the memory 
allocation and bounds checking.

## Rust

In Rust, the standard library provides a safe alternative to C-style strings with the `String` 
type. `String` is a growable, heap-allocated string that automatically manages memory allocation 
and bounds checking.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut buffer = String::new();
    let input = "This is a test".to_string();

    buffer = input;

    println!("{}", buffer);
}
```

In this example, we use `String` to manage the buffer and input strings. The `=` operator 
automatically copies the input string into the buffer, and `String` handles the memory allocation 
and bounds checking.

## Conclusion

CWE-121 is a serious security vulnerability that can lead to buffer overflow attacks. C17 
programmers must manually check the size of buffers before copying data into them, while C++20 and 
Rust provide safer alternatives with `std::string` and `String`, respectively. By using modern 
language features, CWE-121 can be eradicated or mitigated, making programs more secure.
