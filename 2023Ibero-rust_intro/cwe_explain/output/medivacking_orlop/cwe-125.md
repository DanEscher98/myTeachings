# CWE-125: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-125 is a vulnerability that occurs when a user provides input that is longer than the expected 
length of a buffer. This can lead to buffer overflow, which can cause the program to crash or even 
allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

## C17

In C17, buffer overflow is a common problem due to the lack of built-in safety features. Developers 
must manually check the length of input and ensure that it does not exceed the size of the buffer. 
This can be tedious and error-prone, leading to potential vulnerabilities.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    char input[20];
    printf("Enter input: ");
    scanf("%s", input);
    if (strlen(input) > 10) {
        printf("Input too long!\n");
        return 1;
    }
    strcpy(buffer, input);
    printf("Buffer: %s\n", buffer);
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we allocate a buffer of size 10 and read input from the user. We then check the 
length of the input and copy it to the buffer if it is not too long. However, this code is 
vulnerable to buffer overflow if the user enters input that is longer than 10 characters.

## C++20

C++20 introduces several new features that can help mitigate buffer overflow vulnerabilities. One 
such feature is `std::span`, which provides a view over a contiguous sequence of objects. This can 
be used to safely pass arrays to functions without the need for explicit length parameters.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <span>

void print(std::span<const int> arr) {
    for (const auto& elem : arr) {
        std::cout << elem << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    print(arr);
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we define a function `print` that takes a `std::span` of `const int` as its 
parameter. We can then pass an array to this function without the need for an explicit length 
parameter. This helps to prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities by ensuring that the function only 
accesses elements within the bounds of the array.

## Rust

Rust is designed with memory safety in mind and provides several features that can help prevent 
buffer overflow vulnerabilities. One such feature is the `Vec` type, which provides a dynamically 
resizable array.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut vec = Vec::new();
    vec.push(1);
    vec.push(2);
    vec.push(3);
    vec.push(4);
    vec.push(5);
    println!("{:?}", vec);
}
```

In this example, we create a new `Vec` and push several elements onto it. The `Vec` automatically 
resizes itself as needed, preventing buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Additionally, Rust provides 
several other safety features, such as bounds checking and ownership, that can help prevent other 
types of memory-related vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion

C17 is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the lack of built-in safety features. C++20 introduces 
`std::span`, which can help mitigate buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Rust provides several 
features, such as `Vec`, that can help prevent buffer overflow and other memory-related 
vulnerabilities. When writing code, it is important to rely on language features rather than coding 
patterns to ensure the safety and security of the program.
