# CWE-121: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-121 is a weakness related to stack-based buffer overflow. It occurs when a program writes more 
data to a buffer than it can hold, causing the excess data to overwrite adjacent memory locations. 
This can lead to crashes, data corruption, and even remote code execution.

## C17

C17 does not provide any built-in protection against CWE-121. Programmers must manually ensure that 
buffer sizes are not exceeded. This can be error-prone and difficult to maintain, especially in 
large codebases.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    char input[20];
    printf("Enter a string: ");
    fgets(input, 20, stdin);
    strncpy(buffer, input, 10);
    printf("Buffer contents: %s\n", buffer);
    return 0;
}
```

This example reads a string from the user and copies it into a buffer of size 10 using `strncpy()`. 
However, if the user enters a string longer than 10 characters, the buffer will overflow, causing 
undefined behavior.

## C++20

C++20 introduces the `std::span` class, which provides a safe way to work with arrays and buffers. 
A `span` is a view into a contiguous sequence of objects, and it includes both a pointer to the 
first element and a size.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <span>

int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    std::span<char> span(buffer);
    std::cin.getline(span.data(), span.size());
    std::cout << "Buffer contents: " << span.data() << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This example uses `std::span` to create a view into a buffer of size 10. The `std::cin.getline()` 
function is used to read a line of input from the user, ensuring that the buffer is not overflowed. 
The `span.data()` function returns a pointer to the first element of the buffer, which can be used 
with standard library functions.

## Rust

Rust provides built-in protection against buffer overflows through its ownership and borrowing 
system. Rust ensures that each value has a single owner at any given time, and borrows can be used 
to provide temporary access to a value without transferring ownership.

```rust
use std::io::{self, BufRead};

fn main() {
    let mut buffer = String::with_capacity(10);
    let stdin = io::stdin();
    let mut handle = stdin.lock();
    handle.read_line(&mut buffer).unwrap();
    println!("Buffer contents: {}", buffer);
}
```

This example uses Rust's standard library to read a line of input from the user into a `String` 
buffer of size 10. The `with_capacity()` function is used to pre-allocate the buffer, ensuring that 
it cannot be resized and causing a buffer overflow. The `read_line()` function is used to read a 
line of input from the user, ensuring that the buffer is not overflowed.

## Conclusion

C17 provides no built-in protection against CWE-121, making it difficult for programmers to ensure 
that buffer sizes are not exceeded. C++20 introduces the `std::span` class, which provides a safe 
way to work with arrays and buffers. Rust provides built-in protection against buffer overflows 
through its ownership and borrowing system. By using modern features, CWE-121 can be eradicated or 
mitigated in these languages.
