# CWE-476: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-476 is a common weakness in C and C++ programming languages that involves the use of strcpy() 
and strcat() functions without proper bounds checking, leading to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. 
Rust, being a memory-safe language, does not have this vulnerability.

## C17

In C17, the CWE-476 can be mitigated by using the strncpy() function instead of strcpy() and 
strncat() instead of strcat(). These functions take an additional argument specifying the maximum 
number of characters to copy or concatenate, preventing buffer overflows.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char dest[10] = "hello";
    char src[] = "world";
    strncat(dest, src, sizeof(dest) - strlen(dest) - 1);
    printf("%s\n", dest);
    return 0;
}
```

## C++20

In C++20, the CWE-476 can be eradicated by using the std::string class instead of C-style strings. 
The std::string class automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation, preventing buffer 
overflows.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string str = "hello";
    str += "world";
    std::cout << str << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Rust

In Rust, the CWE-476 is not an issue due to its ownership and borrowing system. Rust ensures that 
there is only one mutable reference to a piece of data at a time, preventing buffer overflows.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");
    s.push_str("world");
    println!("{}", s);
}
```

## Conclusion

C17 and C++20 provide ways to mitigate and eradicate CWE-476, respectively, but they still rely on 
the programmer to use them correctly. Rust, on the other hand, eliminates the vulnerability 
entirely through its ownership and borrowing system. When working with C and C++, it is important 
to use the appropriate functions and be mindful of buffer sizes to prevent buffer overflows. Rust 
provides a safer alternative for systems programming.
