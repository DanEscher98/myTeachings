# CWE-126: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-126 is a vulnerability that occurs when a program uses a buffer or stack without proper bounds 
checking, leading to buffer overflow or stack overflow. This can result in a security breach or a 
crash of the program.

## C17

In C17, the CWE-126 can be handled by using the `strncpy` function instead of `strcpy`. `strncpy` 
allows the programmer to specify the maximum number of characters to copy, preventing buffer 
overflow. However, this function is error-prone and can lead to unexpected behavior if not used 
correctly.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char dest[10];
    char src[] = "Hello, world!";

    strncpy(dest, src, sizeof(dest));
    dest[sizeof(dest) - 1] = '\0';

    printf("%s\n", dest);

    return 0;
}
```

## C++20

In C++20, the CWE-126 can be handled by using the `std::string` class instead of C-style strings. 
`std::string` automatically manages the memory allocation and deallocation, preventing buffer 
overflow and stack overflow. Additionally, C++20 introduces the `std::span` class, which provides a 
safe way to access a contiguous sequence of objects.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <span>

int main() {
    std::string str = "Hello, world!";
    std::span<char> span(str);

    std::cout << span.subspan(0, 5).data() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Rust

In Rust, the CWE-126 is eradicated by the ownership and borrowing system. Rust's ownership system 
ensures that each value has a unique owner, preventing multiple pointers from accessing the same 
memory location. Additionally, Rust's borrowing system allows for safe and efficient access to 
memory without the risk of buffer overflow or stack overflow.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("Hello, world!");
    let slice = &mut s[..5];

    println!("{}", slice);
}
```

## Conclusion

C17 provides a basic solution to the CWE-126 with the `strncpy` function, but it is error-prone and 
can lead to unexpected behavior. C++20 provides a safer and more efficient solution with the 
`std::string` class and the `std::span` class. Rust's ownership and borrowing system eradicates the 
CWE-126 completely, providing a safe and efficient way to handle memory.
