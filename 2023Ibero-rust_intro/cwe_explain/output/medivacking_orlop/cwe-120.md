# CWE-120: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-120 is a weakness related to buffer overflow, which occurs when a program writes data beyond 
the end of a buffer allocated for it. This can lead to memory corruption, crashes, and even 
security vulnerabilities.

## C17

In C17, buffer overflows are a common problem due to the lack of built-in safety features. 
Programmers must manually manage memory allocation and ensure that they do not write beyond the 
allocated buffer.

### Idiomatic Example

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    char input[20] = "This is a test";

    // Copy input into buffer, but ensure it doesn't overflow
    strncpy(buffer, input, sizeof(buffer) - 1);
    buffer[sizeof(buffer) - 1] = '\0';

    printf("%s\n", buffer);

    return 0;
}
```

This example uses `strncpy` to copy the input string into the buffer, ensuring that it does not 
overflow. The `sizeof` operator is used to determine the size of the buffer, and the last character 
is set to a null terminator to ensure that the string is properly terminated.

## C++20

C++20 introduces several new features that can help mitigate buffer overflow vulnerabilities, 
including `std::span` and `std::ranges::subrange`.

### Idiomatic Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <span>

int main() {
    std::string input = "This is a test";
    std::span<char> buffer{new char[10], 10};

    // Copy input into buffer, but ensure it doesn't overflow
    std::ranges::copy(input, buffer.begin());

    std::cout << buffer.data() << std::endl;

    delete[] buffer.data();

    return 0;
}
```

This example uses `std::span` to create a view of a fixed-size buffer, and `std::ranges::copy` to 
copy the input string into the buffer. The `new` operator is used to allocate memory for the 
buffer, and the `delete[]` operator is used to free the memory when it is no longer needed.

## Rust

Rust's ownership and borrowing system provides built-in safety features that can help prevent 
buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

### Idiomatic Example

```rust
fn main() {
    let input = "This is a test".to_string();
    let mut buffer = [0u8; 10];

    // Copy input into buffer, but ensure it doesn't overflow
    buffer[..input.len()].copy_from_slice(input.as_bytes());

    println!("{}", String::from_utf8_lossy(&buffer));
}
```

This example uses a fixed-size array to create a buffer, and the `copy_from_slice` method to copy 
the input string into the buffer. The `..` syntax is used to create a slice of the buffer that is 
the same size as the input string, ensuring that it does not overflow. Rust's ownership and 
borrowing system ensures that the buffer is not modified or accessed after it is no longer needed.

## Conclusion

C17 lacks built-in safety features to prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities, while C++20 and Rust 
provide modern features that can help mitigate these vulnerabilities. C++20 introduces `std::span` 
and `std::ranges::subrange`, while Rust's ownership and borrowing system provides built-in safety 
features.
