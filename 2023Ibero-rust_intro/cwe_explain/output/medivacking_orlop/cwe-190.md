# CWE-190: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-190 is a Common Weakness Enumeration that refers to an integer overflow or wraparound 
vulnerability. This vulnerability occurs when an integer value is incremented beyond its maximum 
value, causing it to wrap around to a very small or negative value. This can lead to unexpected 
behavior or security vulnerabilities in software.

## C17

In C17, integer overflow is a common problem that can lead to security vulnerabilities. C17 does 
not provide any built-in protection against integer overflow, so it is up to the programmer to 
ensure that integer values are properly checked and validated.

### Idiomatic Example

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>

int main() {
    uint32_t a = UINT32_MAX;
    uint32_t b = 1;
    uint32_t c = a + b; // integer overflow

    printf("%u\n", c);

    return 0;
}
```

This code demonstrates an integer overflow vulnerability in C17. The `a` variable is set to the 
maximum value of a 32-bit unsigned integer, and the `b` variable is set to 1. When these values are 
added together, the result overflows and wraps around to a very small value. This can lead to 
unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities in software.

## C++20

In C++20, integer overflow is still a common problem, but the language provides some built-in 
protection against it. C++20 introduces the `std::overflow_error` exception, which can be thrown 
when an integer overflow occurs.

### Idiomatic Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdint>
#include <limits>

int main() {
    uint32_t a = std::numeric_limits<uint32_t>::max();
    uint32_t b = 1;
    uint32_t c;

    try {
        c = __builtin_add_overflow(a, b, &c);
    } catch (std::overflow_error& e) {
        std::cerr << "Integer overflow occurred: " << e.what() << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    std::cout << c << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code demonstrates how to use the `__builtin_add_overflow` function to detect integer overflow 
in C++20. The `a` variable is set to the maximum value of a 32-bit unsigned integer, and the `b` 
variable is set to 1. The `__builtin_add_overflow` function is used to add these values together 
and detect any overflow that occurs. If an overflow occurs, the function throws a 
`std::overflow_error` exception, which can be caught and handled appropriately.

## Rust

In Rust, integer overflow is not a problem by default. Rust provides built-in protection against 
integer overflow through its type system. Rust has two types of integers: `u32` and `i32`. The 
`u32` type is an unsigned 32-bit integer, and the `i32` type is a signed 32-bit integer. Rust will 
automatically check for integer overflow at compile time and prevent it from occurring.

### Idiomatic Example

```rust
fn main() {
    let a: u32 = std::u32::MAX;
    let b: u32 = 1;
    let c = a.checked_add(b);

    match c {
        Some(result) => println!("{}", result),
        None => println!("Integer overflow occurred"),
    }
}
```

This code demonstrates how to use the `checked_add` method to detect integer overflow in Rust. The 
`a` variable is set to the maximum value of a 32-bit unsigned integer, and the `b` variable is set 
to 1. The `checked_add` method is used to add these values together and detect any overflow that 
occurs. If an overflow occurs, the method returns `None`, which can be matched and handled 
appropriately.

## Conclusion

In summary, C17 does not provide any built-in protection against integer overflow, while C++20 and 
Rust provide some level of protection. C++20 introduces the `std::overflow_error` exception and the 
`__builtin_add_overflow` function to detect integer overflow, while Rust provides built-in 
protection through its type system and the `checked_add` method. It is important for programmers to 
be aware of integer overflow vulnerabilities and to use appropriate techniques to prevent them.
