# CWE-119: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-119 is a common weakness in software development that involves the use of a buffer overflow. 
This can occur when a program attempts to write data to a buffer that is too small to hold the 
data, resulting in the data being written to adjacent memory locations. This can lead to a variety 
of security vulnerabilities, including the execution of arbitrary code.

## C17

In C17, buffer overflows are a common problem due to the lack of built-in safety features. However, 
there are several ways to mitigate this issue, such as using the `strncpy` function instead of 
`strcpy` to copy strings. This function limits the number of characters that can be copied to the 
destination buffer, preventing buffer overflows.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    char *str = "Hello, world!";
    strncpy(buffer, str, sizeof(buffer));
    buffer[sizeof(buffer) - 1] = '\0';
    printf("%s\n", buffer);
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we use `strncpy` to copy the string "Hello, world!" to a buffer with a size of 10 
bytes. We also add a null terminator to the end of the buffer to ensure that it is properly 
terminated.

## C++20

C++20 introduces several new features that can help mitigate buffer overflows, including the 
`std::span` class and the `std::string_view` class. These classes provide a safe way to work with 
arrays and strings, respectively, by providing bounds checking and other safety features.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <span>
#include <string_view>

int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    std::string_view str = "Hello, world!";
    std::span<char> span(buffer, sizeof(buffer));
    std::copy(str.begin(), str.end(), span.begin());
    buffer[sizeof(buffer) - 1] = '\0';
    std::cout << buffer << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we use `std::span` to create a view of the buffer with a size of 10 bytes. We then 
use `std::copy` to copy the string "Hello, world!" to the buffer, ensuring that we do not exceed 
the bounds of the buffer. Finally, we add a null terminator to the end of the buffer to ensure that 
it is properly terminated.

## Rust

Rust is a language that is designed to be memory-safe, making it an excellent choice for mitigating 
buffer overflows. Rust provides several features that can help prevent buffer overflows, including 
bounds checking and ownership semantics.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut buffer = [0u8; 10];
    let str = "Hello, world!";
    let bytes = str.as_bytes();
    buffer[..bytes.len()].copy_from_slice(bytes);
    println!("{}", std::str::from_utf8(&buffer).unwrap());
}
```

In this example, we create a mutable buffer with a size of 10 bytes. We then convert the string 
"Hello, world!" to a byte slice and copy it to the buffer using the `copy_from_slice` method. This 
method ensures that we do not exceed the bounds of the buffer. Finally, we convert the buffer back 
to a string and print it to the console.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, while all three languages can mitigate CWE-119, Rust provides the most idiomatic and 
safe way to handle buffer overflows due to its built-in safety features. C++20 also provides some 
useful features for working with arrays and strings, while C17 requires more manual effort to 
prevent buffer overflows.
