# CWE-415: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-415 is a type of double-free vulnerability that occurs when a program frees the same memory 
address twice. This can lead to memory corruption and potentially allow an attacker to execute 
arbitrary code. In this article, we will discuss how C17, C++20, and Rust handle this vulnerability 
idiomatically.

## C17

In C17, there is no built-in protection against CWE-415. Programmers must manually keep track of 
which memory addresses have been freed and ensure that they are not freed again. This can be a 
difficult task, especially in large and complex programs.

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int* ptr = malloc(sizeof(int));
    free(ptr);
    free(ptr); // double-free vulnerability
    return 0;
}
```

## C++20

In C++20, the standard library provides a solution to CWE-415 through the use of smart pointers. 
Smart pointers are objects that behave like pointers but also manage the memory they point to. They 
automatically free the memory when they go out of scope, preventing double-free vulnerabilities.

```c++
#include <memory>

int main() {
    std::unique_ptr<int> ptr = std::make_unique<int>();
    // no need to call free()
    return 0;
}
```

## Rust

In Rust, the ownership system prevents CWE-415 by ensuring that each memory address has only one 
owner at a time. When the owner goes out of scope, Rust automatically frees the memory. This 
prevents double-free vulnerabilities and other memory-related issues.

```rust
fn main() {
    let ptr = Box::new(42);
    // no need to call free()
}
```

## Conclusion

C17 provides no built-in protection against CWE-415, leaving programmers to manually manage memory. 
C++20 provides a solution through the use of smart pointers, while Rust's ownership system prevents 
the vulnerability altogether. When writing code, it is important to consider the language's 
features and choose the appropriate solution for the task at hand.
