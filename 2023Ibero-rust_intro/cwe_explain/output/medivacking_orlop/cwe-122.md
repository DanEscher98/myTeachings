# CWE-122: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-122 is a common weakness in software development that involves the use of an incorrect operator 
or expression that can lead to buffer overflow or memory corruption. In this article, we will 
discuss how C17, C++20, and Rust handle this issue idiomatically.

## C17

C17 is a low-level programming language that provides direct access to memory and hardware 
resources. As such, it is prone to CWE-122 issues. However, modern C17 compilers provide some 
features that can help mitigate this issue.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    char* str = "Hello, world!";
    strncpy(buffer, str, sizeof(buffer) - 1);
    buffer[sizeof(buffer) - 1] = '\0';
    printf("%s\n", buffer);
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we use the `strncpy` function to copy the string `str` into the buffer `buffer`. 
We also use the `sizeof` operator to ensure that we do not overflow the buffer. Finally, we add a 
null terminator to the buffer to ensure that it is properly terminated.

## C++20

C++20 is a modern version of C++ that provides many features to help mitigate CWE-122 issues. One 
such feature is the use of smart pointers.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

int main() {
    std::unique_ptr<char[]> buffer(new char[10]);
    const char* str = "Hello, world!";
    std::strncpy(buffer.get(), str, 9);
    buffer[9] = '\0';
    std::cout << buffer.get() << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we use a `std::unique_ptr` to manage the memory for the buffer. We also use the 
`std::strncpy` function to copy the string `str` into the buffer. Finally, we add a null terminator 
to the buffer to ensure that it is properly terminated.

## Rust

Rust is a modern systems programming language that provides many features to help mitigate CWE-122 
issues. One such feature is the use of safe memory management.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut buffer: [u8; 10] = [0; 10];
    let str = "Hello, world!";
    buffer[..str.len()].copy_from_slice(str.as_bytes());
    println!("{}", std::str::from_utf8(&buffer).unwrap());
}
```

In this example, we use a fixed-size array to represent the buffer. We also use the 
`copy_from_slice` method to copy the bytes from the string `str` into the buffer. Finally, we use 
the `std::str::from_utf8` function to convert the buffer into a string.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, all three languages provide features to help mitigate CWE-122 issues. However, Rust 
provides the most robust solution by using safe memory management. C++20 provides a good solution 
by using smart pointers, while C17 provides a basic solution by using the `strncpy` function.
