# CWE-676: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-676 refers to the use of potentially dangerous functions such as `strcpy` and `strcat` in C and 
C++ programming languages. These functions do not perform bounds checking and can lead to buffer 
overflows, which can be exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code or crash the program. 
Rust, on the other hand, is a memory-safe language that prevents buffer overflows and other 
memory-related vulnerabilities.

## C17

In C17, the CWE-676 idiom can be mitigated by using the `strncpy` and `strncat` functions instead 
of `strcpy` and `strcat`. These functions take an additional argument that specifies the maximum 
number of characters to copy or concatenate, preventing buffer overflows. However, this approach 
can still be error-prone if the maximum length is not calculated correctly.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char src[10] = "hello";
    char dest[10] = "world";
    strncat(dest, src, sizeof(dest) - strlen(dest) - 1);
    printf("%s\n", dest);
    return 0;
}
```

## C++20

In C++20, the CWE-676 idiom can be eradicated by using the `std::string` class instead of C-style 
strings. `std::string` automatically manages memory and performs bounds checking, preventing buffer 
overflows. Additionally, C++20 introduces the `std::span` class, which provides a safe way to work 
with arrays and prevents buffer overflows.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <span>

int main() {
    std::string src = "hello";
    std::string dest = "world";
    dest.append(std::span(src).subspan(0, src.size()));
    std::cout << dest << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Rust

In Rust, the CWE-676 idiom is eradicated by the ownership and borrowing system. Rust ensures that 
memory is managed safely and prevents buffer overflows by checking the bounds of arrays and slices 
at compile time. Additionally, Rust provides the `String` and `Vec` types, which automatically 
manage memory and perform bounds checking.

```rust
fn main() {
    let src = "hello".to_string();
    let mut dest = "world".to_string();
    dest.push_str(&src);
    println!("{}", dest);
}
```

## Conclusion

C17 provides a partial solution to the CWE-676 idiom by using `strncpy` and `strncat`, but it can 
still be error-prone. C++20 provides a safer solution by using `std::string` and `std::span`, which 
automatically manage memory and perform bounds checking. Rust provides the safest solution by using 
its ownership and borrowing system, which prevents buffer overflows at compile time.
