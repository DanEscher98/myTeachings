# CWE-401: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-401 is a Common Weakness Enumeration that refers to the use of a function or feature that is 
considered unsafe or prone to errors. In this case, we will analyze how C17, C++20, and Rust handle 
this CWE idiomatically.

## C17

C17 is a programming language that is known for its low-level capabilities and its ability to 
interact with hardware. However, it is also known for its lack of safety features, which can lead 
to vulnerabilities.

In C17, the CWE-401 can be mitigated by using the `strcpy_s` function instead of the `strcpy` 
function. The `strcpy_s` function is a safer version of `strcpy` that takes an additional parameter 
to specify the size of the destination buffer.

```c
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char src[] = "Hello, world!";
    char dest[5];

    // Copy the string from src to dest using strcpy_s
    strcpy_s(dest, sizeof(dest), src);

    return 0;
}
```

## C++20

C++20 is a modern version of C++ that includes many safety features and improvements over previous 
versions. In C++20, the CWE-401 can be eradicated by using the `std::string` class instead of 
C-style strings.

```c++
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string src = "Hello, world!";
    std::string dest;

    // Copy the string from src to dest using the assignment operator
    dest = src;

    return 0;
}
```

## Rust

Rust is a modern systems programming language that is designed to be safe and secure. In Rust, the 
CWE-401 can be eradicated by using the `String` type instead of C-style strings.

```rust
fn main() {
    let src = String::from("Hello, world!");
    let mut dest = String::new();

    // Copy the string from src to dest using the clone method
    dest = src.clone();

    // Alternatively, we can use the assignment operator
    // dest = src;

    // Print the contents of dest
    println!("{}", dest);
}
```

## Conclusion

In conclusion, C17 can mitigate the CWE-401 by using the `strcpy_s` function, while C++20 and Rust 
can eradicate the CWE-401 by using the `std::string` and `String` types, respectively. It is 
important to note that using modern features and relying on language features rather than coding 
patterns can help mitigate vulnerabilities and improve the safety and security of our code.
