# CWE-191: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-191 is a Common Weakness Enumeration that refers to the use of pointer arithmetic to access 
memory locations outside the bounds of an array. This can lead to buffer overflows, which can cause 
security vulnerabilities and crashes.

## C17

In C17, the CWE-191 can be handled by using the `memcpy()` function instead of pointer arithmetic 
to copy data between arrays. This function takes care of the bounds checking and ensures that the 
data is copied safely.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char src[10] = "Hello";
    char dest[5];

    // Using memcpy to copy data between arrays
    memcpy(dest, src, sizeof(dest));

    printf("Dest: %s\n", dest);
    return 0;
}
```

## C++20

In C++20, the CWE-191 can be handled by using the `std::span` class, which provides a safe way to 
access arrays and sequences. The `std::span` class keeps track of the size of the array and ensures 
that the access is within bounds.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <span>

int main() {
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    std::span<int> s(arr, 5);

    // Accessing the array using std::span
    for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
        std::cout << s[i] << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Rust

In Rust, the CWE-191 can be handled by using the `Vec` type, which is a dynamic array that keeps 
track of its size and ensures that the access is within bounds. The `Vec` type is part of the 
standard library and provides a safe and idiomatic way to handle arrays.

```rust
fn main() {
    let arr = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    // Accessing the array using Vec
    for i in &arr {
        println!("{}", i);
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

In summary, the CWE-191 can be handled in different ways depending on the programming language. In 
C17, the `memcpy()` function can be used to copy data between arrays safely. In C++20, the 
`std::span` class provides a safe way to access arrays and sequences. In Rust, the `Vec` type is a 
dynamic array that ensures safe access to its elements. It is important to use the idiomatic 
features of each language to handle the CWE-191 and avoid security vulnerabilities and crashes.
