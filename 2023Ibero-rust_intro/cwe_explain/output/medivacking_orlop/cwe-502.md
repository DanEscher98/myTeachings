# CWE-502: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-502 is a weakness that occurs when a function does not properly restrict the size of an array, 
which can lead to a buffer overflow. In this article, we will discuss how C17, C++20, and Rust 
handle this CWE idiomatically.

## C17

In C17, there is no built-in mechanism to prevent buffer overflows. Programmers must manually check 
the size of arrays and ensure that they do not exceed their bounds. This can be error-prone and 
lead to security vulnerabilities.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    int i;

    printf("Enter a string: ");
    scanf("%s", buffer);

    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        printf("%c", buffer[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the buffer size is 10, but the `scanf` function does not restrict the size of the 
input string. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input string is longer than 10 characters.

## C++20

In C++20, the `std::span` class can be used to prevent buffer overflows. A `std::span` is a 
non-owning view of a contiguous sequence of objects, such as an array. It provides bounds checking 
to ensure that accesses are within the bounds of the sequence.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <span>

int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    int i;

    std::cout << "Enter a string: ";
    std::cin >> std::span<char>(buffer, 10);

    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        std::cout << buffer[i];
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `std::span` class is used to restrict the size of the input string to 10 
characters. If the input string is longer than 10 characters, an exception will be thrown.

## Rust

In Rust, buffer overflows are prevented by the ownership and borrowing system. Rust's ownership 
system ensures that there is only one owner of a piece of data at a time, and that owner can modify 
the data. Borrowing allows multiple references to the data, but only one reference can be mutable 
at a time.

```rust
use std::io::{self, Read};

fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    let mut buffer = [0; 10];

    println!("Enter a string: ");
    io::stdin().read(&mut buffer)?;

    for i in 0..10 {
        print!("{}", buffer[i] as char);
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

In this example, the `read` function is used to read input into the `buffer` array. The `&mut` 
reference ensures that only one mutable reference to the `buffer` array exists at a time, 
preventing buffer overflows.

## Conclusion

C17 requires manual checking of array sizes, which can be error-prone and lead to security 
vulnerabilities. C++20's `std::span` class provides bounds checking to prevent buffer overflows. 
Rust's ownership and borrowing system prevents buffer overflows by ensuring that there is only one 
owner of a piece of data at a time, and that owner can modify the data.
