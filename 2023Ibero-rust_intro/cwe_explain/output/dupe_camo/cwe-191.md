# CWE-191: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-191 is a security vulnerability that arises when a pointer is used after it has been freed, 
leading to undefined behavior. This can result in a program crash or even worse, a security breach. 
In this article, we will discuss how C17, C++20, and Rust handle this vulnerability idiomatically.

## C17

In C17, there is no built-in mechanism to prevent CWE-191. It is up to the programmer to ensure 
that pointers are not used after they have been freed. However, there are some coding patterns that 
can help mitigate this vulnerability.

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int *ptr = malloc(sizeof(int));
    if (ptr == NULL) {
        return 1;
    }

    // use ptr

    free(ptr);
    ptr = NULL; // set pointer to NULL after freeing

    // do not use ptr after this point
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we allocate memory for an integer using `malloc()`. After using the pointer, we 
free the memory and set the pointer to `NULL`. This ensures that the pointer cannot be used again, 
preventing CWE-191.

## C++20

In C++20, there is a new feature called `std::unique_ptr` that can help prevent CWE-191. 
`std::unique_ptr` is a smart pointer that automatically deallocates memory when it goes out of 
scope.

```c++
#include <memory>

int main() {
    std::unique_ptr<int> ptr = std::make_unique<int>();

    // use ptr
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we allocate memory for an integer using `std::make_unique()`. The 
`std::unique_ptr` automatically deallocates the memory when it goes out of scope, preventing 
CWE-191.

## Rust

In Rust, memory management is handled by the ownership system. When an object goes out of scope, 
its memory is automatically deallocated. This prevents CWE-191 from occurring.

```rust
fn main() {
    let ptr = Box::new(0);

    // use ptr
}
```

In this example, we allocate memory for an integer using `Box::new()`. When the `ptr` variable goes 
out of scope, its memory is automatically deallocated, preventing CWE-191.

## Conclusion

CWE-191 is a serious security vulnerability that can lead to undefined behavior and security 
breaches. While C17 does not provide any built-in mechanism to prevent this vulnerability, there 
are some coding patterns that can help mitigate it. C++20 provides a new feature called 
`std::unique_ptr` that automatically deallocates memory when it goes out of scope. Rust's ownership 
system automatically deallocates memory when an object goes out of scope. It is important to use 
modern features and rely on language features rather than coding patterns to prevent CWE-191.
