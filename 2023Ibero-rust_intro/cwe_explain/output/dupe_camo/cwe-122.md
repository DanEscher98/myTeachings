# CWE-122: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-122 is a vulnerability that occurs when a program uses an input buffer that is smaller than the 
size of the input data. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can be exploited by attackers to 
execute arbitrary code or crash the program.

## C17

In C17, handling CWE-122 requires careful memory management and input validation. Developers must 
ensure that input data is not larger than the size of the input buffer, and that the buffer is 
properly initialized and freed.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    char *input = malloc(20);
    fgets(input, 20, stdin);
    if (strlen(input) > 10) {
        printf("Input too long\n");
        return 1;
    }
    strcpy(buffer, input);
    printf("Buffer: %s\n", buffer);
    free(input);
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we allocate a buffer of size 10 and an input string of size 20. We use fgets to 
read input from the user, and check if the input is longer than the buffer size. If it is, we print 
an error message and exit. Otherwise, we copy the input to the buffer using strcpy, and print the 
buffer.

## C++20

In C++20, we can use the std::string class to handle strings and avoid buffer overflows. The class 
automatically manages memory allocation and resizing, and provides a range of methods for 
manipulating strings.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string buffer;
    std::string input;
    std::getline(std::cin, input);
    if (input.size() > 10) {
        std::cout << "Input too long" << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }
    buffer = input;
    std::cout << "Buffer: " << buffer << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we use std::string to allocate a buffer and read input from the user. We check if 
the input is longer than the buffer size using the size method, and print an error message if it 
is. Otherwise, we assign the input to the buffer using the assignment operator, and print the 
buffer.

## Rust

In Rust, we can use the String type to handle strings and avoid buffer overflows. The type is 
dynamically allocated and automatically resized, and provides a range of methods for manipulating 
strings.

```rust
use std::io::{self, BufRead};

fn main() {
    let mut buffer = String::new();
    let stdin = io::stdin();
    let mut input = String::new();
    stdin.lock().read_line(&mut input).unwrap();
    if input.len() > 10 {
        println!("Input too long");
        return;
    }
    buffer = input;
    println!("Buffer: {}", buffer);
}
```

In this example, we use the String type to allocate a buffer and read input from the user. We check 
if the input is longer than the buffer size using the len method, and print an error message if it 
is. Otherwise, we assign the input to the buffer using the assignment operator, and print the 
buffer.

## Conclusion

In all three languages, handling CWE-122 requires careful memory management and input validation. 
However, C++20 and Rust provide higher-level abstractions for handling strings that make it easier 
to avoid buffer overflows. Rust's ownership and borrowing system also provides additional safety 
guarantees that can prevent other types of memory-related vulnerabilities.
