# CWE-121: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-121 is a security vulnerability that occurs when a program uses a fixed-length buffer to store 
user input without proper bounds checking, leading to buffer overflow attacks. In this article, we 
will compare how C17, C++20, and Rust handle this vulnerability idiomatically.

## C17

In C17, the CWE-121 vulnerability is still present, and it is up to the programmer to ensure that 
proper bounds checking is performed. However, modern C compilers provide some features that can 
help mitigate this vulnerability.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    char input[20];
    fgets(input, 20, stdin);
    strncpy(buffer, input, 10);
    buffer[9] = '\0';
    printf("%s\n", buffer);
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we use `fgets` to read input from the user, which ensures that the input is not 
longer than the buffer size. We then use `strncpy` to copy the input into the buffer, which ensures 
that the buffer is not overflowed. Finally, we add a null terminator to the buffer to ensure that 
it is properly terminated.

## C++20

In C++20, the `std::span` class can be used to mitigate the CWE-121 vulnerability. `std::span` is a 
non-owning view over a contiguous sequence of objects, and it provides bounds checking at runtime.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <span>

int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    char input[20];
    std::cin.getline(input, 20);
    std::span<char> span(buffer, 10);
    std::copy_n(input, std::min(std::size(input), span.size()), span.begin());
    std::cout << buffer << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we use `std::cin.getline` to read input from the user, which ensures that the 
input is not longer than the buffer size. We then create a `std::span` object over the buffer, 
which provides bounds checking at runtime. Finally, we use `std::copy_n` to copy the input into the 
buffer, ensuring that the buffer is not overflowed.

## Rust

In Rust, the CWE-121 vulnerability is eradicated by the ownership and borrowing system. Rust 
ensures that all memory accesses are safe at compile time, preventing buffer overflow attacks.

```rust
use std::io::{self, BufRead};

fn main() {
    let mut buffer = [0u8; 10];
    let stdin = io::stdin();
    let input = stdin.lock().lines().next().unwrap().unwrap();
    buffer[..input.len().min(buffer.len())].copy_from_slice(&input.as_bytes()[..]);
    println!("{}", String::from_utf8_lossy(&buffer));
}
```

In this example, we create a fixed-size buffer and read input from the user using 
`stdin.lock().lines().next().unwrap().unwrap()`. We then use `copy_from_slice` to copy the input 
into the buffer, ensuring that the buffer is not overflowed. Rust's ownership and borrowing system 
ensures that all memory accesses are safe at compile time, preventing buffer overflow attacks.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, while C17 and C++20 provide some features to mitigate the CWE-121 vulnerability, 
Rust's ownership and borrowing system eradicates the vulnerability entirely. It is important to 
ensure that proper bounds checking is performed when using C17 and C++20, while Rust provides 
safety guarantees at compile time.
