# CWE-125: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-125 is a vulnerability that occurs when a user provides input that is longer than the expected 
buffer size, causing a buffer overflow. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code or a 
denial of service attack. In this article, we will discuss how C17, C++20, and Rust handle this 
vulnerability.

## C17

In C17, buffer overflows are a common vulnerability. To mitigate this, developers must manually 
check the length of input before copying it into a buffer. This can be tedious and error-prone, 
leading to potential vulnerabilities.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    char input[20];
    fgets(input, 20, stdin);
    if (strlen(input) < 10) {
        strcpy(buffer, input);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we manually check the length of the input before copying it into the buffer. If 
the input is longer than the buffer, it will not be copied, preventing a buffer overflow.

## C++20

In C++20, the `std::string` class provides a safer alternative to C-style strings. The 
`std::string` class automatically manages memory allocation and resizing, preventing buffer 
overflows.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string buffer;
    std::string input;
    std::getline(std::cin, input);
    buffer = input;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we use the `std::string` class to manage the buffer. The `std::getline` function 
reads input from the user and stores it in the `input` string. We then assign the `input` string to 
the `buffer` string, which automatically manages memory allocation and resizing.

## Rust

In Rust, buffer overflows are prevented by the ownership and borrowing system. Rust ensures that 
only one owner can access a piece of memory at a time, preventing multiple writes to the same 
buffer.

```rust
use std::io::{self, BufRead};

fn main() {
    let mut buffer = String::new();
    let stdin = io::stdin();
    let mut handle = stdin.lock();
    handle.read_line(&mut buffer).unwrap();
}
```

In this example, we use the `std::io` module to read input from the user and store it in the 
`buffer` string. Rust's ownership and borrowing system ensures that only one owner can access the 
`buffer` string at a time, preventing buffer overflows.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, C17 requires manual length checking to prevent buffer overflows, which can be 
tedious and error-prone. C++20's `std::string` class provides a safer alternative by automatically 
managing memory allocation and resizing. Rust's ownership and borrowing system prevents buffer 
overflows by ensuring that only one owner can access a piece of memory at a time. While all three 
languages can handle CWE-125, Rust's ownership and borrowing system provides a unique approach to 
preventing buffer overflows.
