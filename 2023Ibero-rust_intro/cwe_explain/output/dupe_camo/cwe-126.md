# CWE-126: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-126 is a vulnerability that occurs when a program uses a buffer that is not large enough to 
hold the data that is being written to it. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can be 
exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.

## C17

In C17, the standard library provides functions like `strcpy` and `strcat` that do not perform 
bounds checking. This means that it is up to the programmer to ensure that the destination buffer 
is large enough to hold the data being copied or concatenated.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char dest[10];
    char src[] = "hello world";
    strcpy(dest, src); // buffer overflow!
    printf("%s\n", dest);
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `strcpy` function is used to copy the string `"hello world"` to the `dest` 
buffer, which has a size of only 10 bytes. This results in a buffer overflow, which can cause 
undefined behavior.

## C++20

In C++20, the standard library provides a range of functions that perform bounds checking, such as 
`std::string::append` and `std::string::replace`. These functions take a range of characters as 
input, along with the length of the range, and ensure that the destination buffer is large enough 
to hold the data being copied or concatenated.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string dest(10, ' ');
    std::string src = "hello world";
    dest.replace(0, src.length(), src); // no buffer overflow
    std::cout << dest << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `std::string::replace` function is used to replace the contents of the `dest` 
string with the contents of the `src` string. The `dest` string is initialized with a size of 10 
characters, and the `replace` function ensures that the destination buffer is large enough to hold 
the data being copied.

## Rust

In Rust, the standard library provides a range of safe abstractions for working with strings and 
buffers, such as `String` and `Vec`. These abstractions perform bounds checking at runtime, and 
ensure that the destination buffer is large enough to hold the data being copied or concatenated.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut dest = vec![0; 10];
    let src = "hello world".as_bytes();
    dest[..src.len()].copy_from_slice(src); // no buffer overflow
    println!("{}", String::from_utf8_lossy(&dest));
}
```

In this example, a `Vec` is used to represent the `dest` buffer, and the `copy_from_slice` method 
is used to copy the contents of the `src` buffer to the `dest` buffer. The `Vec` ensures that the 
destination buffer is large enough to hold the data being copied, and the `copy_from_slice` method 
performs bounds checking at runtime.

## Conclusion

C17 provides no built-in protection against buffer overflows, and it is up to the programmer to 
ensure that the destination buffer is large enough to hold the data being copied or concatenated. 
C++20 and Rust provide safe abstractions for working with strings and buffers, which perform bounds 
checking at runtime and ensure that the destination buffer is large enough to hold the data being 
copied or concatenated. While C++20 and Rust provide similar levels of safety, Rust's ownership and 
borrowing system provides additional guarantees against data races and memory leaks.
