# CWE-190: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-190 is a coding weakness that refers to an integer overflow or wraparound vulnerability. This 
vulnerability occurs when an integer value is incremented or decremented beyond its maximum or 
minimum value, causing it to wrap around to the opposite end of the range. This can lead to 
unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities.

## C17

In C17, integer overflow is not handled by the language itself, and it is up to the programmer to 
ensure that it does not occur. This can be done by checking the range of the integer before 
performing any operations on it.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <limits.h>

int main() {
    int x = INT_MAX;
    if (x < INT_MAX) {
        printf("Integer overflow occurred!\n");
    } else {
        printf("No integer overflow occurred.\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we check if the integer `x` is less than `INT_MAX` before performing any 
operations on it. If it is, we know that an integer overflow has occurred.

## C++20

In C++20, the language provides a new feature called `std::overflow_error`, which can be used to 
handle integer overflow. This exception is thrown when an arithmetic operation results in an 
overflow.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <limits>

int main() {
    try {
        int x = std::numeric_limits<int>::max();
        x++;
    } catch (std::overflow_error& e) {
        std::cout << "Integer overflow occurred!\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we attempt to increment the integer `x` beyond its maximum value. This results in 
an overflow, which throws an exception of type `std::overflow_error`. We catch this exception and 
print a message indicating that an integer overflow occurred.

## Rust

In Rust, integer overflow is handled by the language itself. By default, Rust will panic if an 
integer overflow occurs during an arithmetic operation. However, Rust also provides a set of 
checked arithmetic operations that will return a `None` value instead of panicking if an overflow 
occurs.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: i32 = i32::MAX;
    let result = x.checked_add(1);
    match result {
        Some(_) => println!("No integer overflow occurred."),
        None => println!("Integer overflow occurred!"),
    }
}
```

In this example, we attempt to add 1 to the integer `x` beyond its maximum value. This results in 
an overflow, which returns a `None` value instead of panicking. We match on the result and print a 
message indicating whether an integer overflow occurred.

## Conclusion

C17 requires the programmer to manually check for integer overflow, which can be error-prone and 
tedious. C++20 provides a new feature that allows for more robust handling of integer overflow, but 
it still requires the programmer to explicitly handle exceptions. Rust, on the other hand, handles 
integer overflow by default, but also provides a set of checked arithmetic operations for more 
fine-grained control. Overall, Rust seems to be the most idiomatic language for handling integer 
overflow, as it provides a balance between safety and control.
