# CWE-502: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-502 is a weakness that occurs when a function does not properly restrict the size of an array, 
which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. In this article, we will discuss how C17, C++20, 
and Rust handle this CWE idiomatically.

## C17

In C17, the CWE-502 can be mitigated by using the `fgets()` function to read input from the user. 
This function reads a line of text from the input stream and stores it in a buffer, which can be 
safely used without the risk of buffer overflow.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin);
    printf("Input: %s", buffer);
    return 0;
}
```

In the above example, we use `fgets()` to read input from the user and store it in a buffer of size 
10. The `sizeof()` operator is used to ensure that we do not read more data than the buffer can 
hold.

## C++20

In C++20, the CWE-502 can be eradicated by using the `std::string` class to handle strings. This 
class automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation, which eliminates the risk of buffer 
overflow.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string input;
    std::getline(std::cin, input);
    std::cout << "Input: " << input << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In the above example, we use the `std::string` class to store the user input. The `std::getline()` 
function is used to read input from the user and store it in the `input` string. The `std::cout` 
object is used to print the input to the console.

## Rust

In Rust, the CWE-502 can be mitigated by using the `String` type to handle strings. This type is 
similar to the `std::string` class in C++, and it automatically manages memory allocation and 
deallocation.

```rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    let mut input = String::new();
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).unwrap();
    println!("Input: {}", input);
}
```

In the above example, we use the `String` type to store the user input. The `io::stdin()` function 
is used to read input from the user and store it in the `input` string. The `println!()` macro is 
used to print the input to the console.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, we have discussed how C17, C++20, and Rust handle the CWE-502 idiomatically. In C17, 
we can mitigate the CWE by using the `fgets()` function to read input from the user. In C++20 and 
Rust, we can eradicate the CWE by using the `std::string` and `String` types, respectively, to 
handle strings. By using these modern features, we can eliminate the risk of buffer overflow 
vulnerabilities and write safer code.
