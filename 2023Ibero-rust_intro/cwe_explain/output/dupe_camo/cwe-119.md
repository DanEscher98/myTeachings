# CWE-119: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-119 is a common weakness in software development that refers to buffer overflow or buffer 
overrun. This vulnerability occurs when a program tries to write data beyond the boundaries of a 
buffer, leading to memory corruption and potential security issues.

## C17

In C17, buffer overflows are still a common issue, and developers need to be careful when handling 
memory allocation and manipulation. However, modern C17 features such as bounds checking and safer 
string functions can help mitigate this vulnerability.

```c
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    char* input = "Hello, world!";
    strncpy(buffer, input, sizeof(buffer) - 1); // copy input to buffer, ensuring null termination
    buffer[sizeof(buffer) - 1] = '\0'; // ensure null termination
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we use the `strncpy` function to copy the input string to the buffer, ensuring 
that we don't write beyond the buffer's boundaries. We also ensure that the buffer is 
null-terminated, preventing potential issues with string manipulation.

## C++20

C++20 introduces several features that can help prevent buffer overflows, such as `std::span` and 
`std::string_view`. These types provide safe and efficient ways to handle arrays and strings, 
respectively.

```cpp
#include <span>
#include <string_view>

int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    std::string_view input = "Hello, world!";
    std::span<char> span(buffer); // create a span from the buffer
    std::copy_n(input.begin(), std::min(input.size(), span.size()), span.begin()); // copy input to 
span
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we use `std::span` to create a view of the buffer, and `std::string_view` to 
create a view of the input string. We then use `std::copy_n` to copy the input to the buffer, 
ensuring that we don't write beyond the buffer's boundaries.

## Rust

Rust is a memory-safe language that prevents buffer overflows through its ownership and borrowing 
system. Rust's `String` and `Vec` types provide safe and efficient ways to handle strings and 
arrays, respectively.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut buffer = [0; 10];
    let input = "Hello, world!".to_string();
    let bytes = input.as_bytes();
    buffer[..bytes.len()].copy_from_slice(bytes); // copy bytes to buffer
}
```

In this example, we use a fixed-size array for the buffer, and the `String` type for the input. We 
then use `as_bytes` to get a byte slice of the input, and `copy_from_slice` to copy the bytes to 
the buffer, ensuring that we don't write beyond the buffer's boundaries.

## Conclusion

C17, C++20, and Rust provide different ways to handle buffer overflows, with varying levels of 
safety and efficiency. While C17 and C++20 require developers to be careful when handling memory 
allocation and manipulation, Rust's ownership and borrowing system provides a safer and more 
efficient approach. However, all three languages offer modern features that can help mitigate this 
vulnerability, such as bounds checking, safe string functions, and safe array and string types.
