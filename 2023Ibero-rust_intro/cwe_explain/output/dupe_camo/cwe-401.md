# CWE-401: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-401 is a Common Weakness Enumeration that refers to the use of a function pointer to call a 
function that is not of the expected type. This can lead to undefined behavior and security 
vulnerabilities.

## C17

In C17, there is no type checking for function pointers. This means that it is possible to call a 
function with a function pointer that has a different signature, leading to undefined behavior.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void foo(int x) {
    printf("foo: %d\n", x);
}

int main() {
    void (*func_ptr)(int) = (void (*)(int)) &printf; // cast printf to a function pointer
    func_ptr(42); // undefined behavior
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we cast the `printf` function to a function pointer that expects an `int` 
argument. When we call `func_ptr` with the argument `42`, we get undefined behavior because 
`printf` expects a format string and additional arguments.

## C++20

In C++20, we can use `std::function` to create type-safe function pointers. `std::function` is a 
type-erased function wrapper that can store any callable object that matches a specified signature.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <functional>

void foo(int x) {
    std::cout << "foo: " << x << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    std::function<void(int)> func_ptr = foo;
    func_ptr(42);
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we create a `std::function` object that expects a function with the signature 
`void(int)`. We assign the `foo` function to `func_ptr` and call it with the argument `42`. This is 
type-safe and there is no risk of undefined behavior.

## Rust

In Rust, we can use function pointers with a specified signature. Rust's type system ensures that 
the function pointer matches the expected signature.

```rust
fn foo(x: i32) {
    println!("foo: {}", x);
}

fn main() {
    let func_ptr: fn(i32) -> () = foo;
    func_ptr(42);
}
```

In this example, we define the `foo` function with the signature `fn(i32) -> ()`. We create a 
function pointer `func_ptr` that expects a function with the same signature. We assign `foo` to 
`func_ptr` and call it with the argument `42`. This is type-safe and there is no risk of undefined 
behavior.

## Conclusion

C17 does not provide any type checking for function pointers, which can lead to undefined behavior 
and security vulnerabilities. C++20 and Rust provide type-safe function pointers that ensure the 
function signature matches the expected signature. Using modern features, the CWE-401 idiomatically 
eradicated or mitigated in C++20 and Rust.
