# CWE-476: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-476 is a common coding mistake that occurs when a programmer allocates a fixed amount of memory 
for a variable, but then writes more data to that variable than the allocated memory can hold. This 
can lead to buffer overflows, which can cause security vulnerabilities and crashes.

## C17

In C17, buffer overflows are a common problem due to the lack of built-in memory safety features. 
However, there are some idiomatic ways to mitigate the CWE-476 issue.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char buffer[10]; // allocate 10 bytes of memory for buffer
    char *input = "this is a long string"; // input string longer than buffer
    strncpy(buffer, input, sizeof(buffer)); // copy input to buffer
    printf("%s\n", buffer); // print buffer
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we allocate 10 bytes of memory for the buffer, but the input string is longer than 
that. To mitigate the CWE-476 issue, we use the `strncpy` function to copy the input string to the 
buffer, limiting the number of bytes copied to the size of the buffer. This ensures that we don't 
write more data to the buffer than it can hold.

## C++20

In C++20, there are several built-in memory safety features that can help mitigate the CWE-476 
issue. One of these features is the `std::string` class, which automatically manages memory 
allocation and deallocation.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string buffer; // allocate memory for buffer
    std::string input = "this is a long string"; // input string longer than buffer
    buffer = input.substr(0, 10); // copy first 10 characters of input to buffer
    std::cout << buffer << std::endl; // print buffer
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we use the `std::string` class to allocate memory for the buffer. We then use the 
`substr` function to copy the first 10 characters of the input string to the buffer. This ensures 
that we don't write more data to the buffer than it can hold.

## Rust

In Rust, memory safety is enforced by the compiler through the use of ownership and borrowing 
rules. This makes it much harder to make CWE-476 mistakes.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut buffer = String::new(); // allocate memory for buffer
    let input = "this is a long string".to_string(); // input string longer than buffer
    buffer.push_str(&input[..10]); // copy first 10 characters of input to buffer
    println!("{}", buffer); // print buffer
}
```

In this example, we use the `String` type to allocate memory for the buffer. We then use the 
`push_str` function to copy the first 10 characters of the input string to the buffer. The 
`&input[..10]` syntax creates a slice of the input string containing the first 10 characters. This 
ensures that we don't write more data to the buffer than it can hold.

## Conclusion

In summary, CWE-476 is a common coding mistake that can lead to security vulnerabilities and 
crashes. In C17, we can mitigate this issue by using functions like `strncpy` to limit the amount 
of data written to a buffer. In C++20, we can use built-in memory safety features like the 
`std::string` class to automatically manage memory allocation and deallocation. In Rust, memory 
safety is enforced by the compiler through ownership and borrowing rules, making CWE-476 mistakes 
much harder to make.
