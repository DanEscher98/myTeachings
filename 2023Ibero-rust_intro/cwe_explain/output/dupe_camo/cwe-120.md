# CWE-120: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-120 is a weakness related to buffer overflow. It occurs when a program writes data to a buffer 
without performing bounds checking. This can lead to memory corruption, which can be exploited by 
attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.

## C17

In C17, buffer overflow is a common problem due to the lack of built-in safety features. Developers 
must manually perform bounds checking to prevent buffer overflow. However, this can be error-prone 
and time-consuming.

### Idiomatic Example

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    char input[20];

    printf("Enter a string: ");
    fgets(input, sizeof(input), stdin);

    // Ensure null-termination
    input[sizeof(input) - 1] = '\0';

    // Copy input to buffer, with bounds checking
    strncpy(buffer, input, sizeof(buffer) - 1);
    buffer[sizeof(buffer) - 1] = '\0';

    printf("Buffer contents: %s\n", buffer);

    return 0;
}
```

This example uses `strncpy` to copy the input to the buffer, ensuring that no more than 
`sizeof(buffer) - 1` characters are copied. The `sizeof` operator is used to calculate the size of 
the buffer and input arrays, ensuring that the bounds checking is correct.

## C++20

C++20 introduces several new features that can help mitigate buffer overflow. These include 
`std::span`, which provides a view of a contiguous sequence of objects, and 
`std::ranges::subrange`, which provides a view of a subrange of a sequence.

### Idiomatic Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <span>

int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    char input[20];

    std::cout << "Enter a string: ";
    std::cin.getline(input, sizeof(input));

    // Ensure null-termination
    input[sizeof(input) - 1] = '\0';

    // Copy input to buffer, with bounds checking
    std::span<char> input_span(input);
    std::span<char> buffer_span(buffer);
    std::ranges::copy(input_span.subspan(0, buffer_span.size()), buffer_span.begin());

    std::cout << "Buffer contents: " << buffer << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This example uses `std::span` and `std::ranges::subspan` to create views of the input and buffer 
arrays. The `std::ranges::copy` algorithm is used to copy the input to the buffer, ensuring that no 
more than `buffer_span.size()` characters are copied.

## Rust

Rust provides several safety features that can help prevent buffer overflow. These include bounds 
checking on array accesses, and the `String` type, which automatically manages memory allocation 
and bounds checking.

### Idiomatic Example

```rust
use std::io::{self, BufRead};

fn main() {
    let mut buffer = [0u8; 10];
    let mut input = String::new();

    print!("Enter a string: ");
    io::stdout().flush().unwrap();
    io::stdin().lock().read_line(&mut input).unwrap();

    // Ensure null-termination
    input.truncate(19);

    // Copy input to buffer, with bounds checking
    buffer.copy_from_slice(&input.as_bytes()[..buffer.len()]);

    println!("Buffer contents: {:?}", buffer);
}
```

This example uses the `String` type to manage memory allocation and bounds checking. The `truncate` 
method is used to ensure that the input string is no longer than 19 characters, and the 
`copy_from_slice` method is used to copy the input to the buffer, ensuring that no more than 
`buffer.len()` characters are copied. The `as_bytes` method is used to convert the input string to 
a byte slice, which can be copied to the buffer.
