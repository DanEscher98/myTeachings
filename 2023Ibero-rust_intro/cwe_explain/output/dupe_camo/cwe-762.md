# CWE-762: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-762 is a security vulnerability that occurs when a program uses a pointer to a freed memory 
block. This can lead to undefined behavior, including crashes, data corruption, and even remote 
code execution.

## C17

In C17, the CWE-762 can be mitigated by setting the pointer to NULL after freeing the memory block. 
However, this is not foolproof and can still lead to undefined behavior if the pointer is used 
after being freed.

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int* ptr = malloc(sizeof(int));
    *ptr = 42;
    free(ptr);
    ptr = NULL; // set pointer to NULL after freeing memory
    // ...
}
```

## C++20

In C++20, the CWE-762 can be eradicated by using smart pointers, such as `std::unique_ptr` or 
`std::shared_ptr`. These smart pointers automatically manage the memory and ensure that the memory 
is freed when it is no longer needed.

```cpp
#include <memory>

int main() {
    std::unique_ptr<int> ptr = std::make_unique<int>(42);
    // ...
}
```

## Rust

In Rust, the CWE-762 is eradicated by using the ownership system. Rust ensures that each value has 
a unique owner, and when the owner goes out of scope, the value is automatically dropped and the 
memory is freed.

```rust
fn main() {
    let ptr = Box::new(42);
    // ...
}
```

## Conclusion

C17 can mitigate the CWE-762 by setting the pointer to NULL after freeing the memory block, but 
this is not foolproof. C++20 can eradicate the CWE-762 by using smart pointers, which automatically 
manage the memory. Rust can eradicate the CWE-762 by using the ownership system, which ensures that 
each value has a unique owner and the memory is automatically freed when the owner goes out of 
scope.
