# CWE-119: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-119 is a common weakness in software development that refers to buffer overflow or buffer 
overrun. It occurs when a program tries to write data beyond the boundaries of a fixed-length 
buffer, causing memory corruption and potentially leading to security vulnerabilities.

## C17

C17 is a low-level programming language that provides direct access to memory and hardware 
resources. It is prone to CWE-119 due to its lack of built-in safety features and manual memory 
management.

To handle CWE-119 idiomatically in C17, programmers can use functions such as `strncpy()` and 
`snprintf()` to limit the amount of data written to a buffer. However, these functions can still be 
vulnerable to edge cases and require careful implementation.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    char* data = "0123456789abcdef";
    strncpy(buffer, data, sizeof(buffer) - 1);
    buffer[sizeof(buffer) - 1] = '\0';
    printf("%s\n", buffer);
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `strncpy()` is used to copy the data to the buffer with a maximum length of 
`sizeof(buffer) - 1`. The last character is set to null to terminate the string. However, if the 
length of the data exceeds the buffer size, the null character will not be added, leading to a 
potential buffer overflow.

## C++20

C++20 is a modern version of C++ that introduces new features and improvements to the language. It 
provides better support for memory safety and reduces the risk of CWE-119.

To handle CWE-119 idiomatically in C++20, programmers can use the `std::string` class instead of 
raw character arrays. `std::string` automatically manages memory allocation and provides bounds 
checking to prevent buffer overflows.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string buffer;
    std::string data = "0123456789abcdef";
    buffer = data.substr(0, 10);
    std::cout << buffer << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `std::string` is used to store the data and limit the length to 10 characters 
using the `substr()` function. The output is the same as the C17 example, but with added safety and 
simplicity.

## Rust

Rust is a modern systems programming language that emphasizes memory safety and thread safety. It 
provides built-in features to prevent CWE-119 and other memory-related vulnerabilities.

To handle CWE-119 idiomatically in Rust, programmers can use the `String` type instead of raw 
character arrays. `String` is a growable, heap-allocated string that automatically manages memory 
allocation and provides bounds checking.

```rust
fn main() {
    let buffer = String::new();
    let data = String::from("0123456789abcdef");
    let _ = buffer.push_str(&data[..10]);
    println!("{}", buffer);
}
```

In this example, `String` is used to store the data and limit the length to 10 characters using the 
`..` range operator. The `push_str()` function is used to append the data to the buffer. The output 
is the same as the previous examples, but with added safety and expressiveness.

## Conclusion

CWE-119 is a common weakness in software development that can lead to security vulnerabilities. 
C17, C++20, and Rust provide different approaches to handle CWE-119 idiomatically. While C17 
requires careful implementation and manual memory management, C++20 and Rust provide built-in 
safety features and simplify the code. Programmers should choose the language that best fits their 
needs and requirements, but should always prioritize memory safety and security.
