# CWE-120: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-120 is a weakness in C/C++ programming languages that refers to the use of an unsafe function 
or operation that can lead to a buffer overflow or memory corruption. In this article, we will 
discuss how C17, C++20, and Rust handle this CWE idiomatically.

## C17

C17 does not provide any built-in mechanisms to prevent CWE-120. However, it provides some 
functions that can be used to mitigate the risk of buffer overflow, such as `strncpy()` and 
`snprintf()`. These functions limit the number of characters that can be copied to a buffer, 
preventing buffer overflow.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    char* str = "Hello, world!";
    strncpy(buffer, str, sizeof(buffer) - 1);
    buffer[sizeof(buffer) - 1] = '\0';
    printf("%s\n", buffer);
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we use `strncpy()` to copy the string `str` to the buffer `buffer`. We limit the 
number of characters copied to `sizeof(buffer) - 1` to prevent buffer overflow. We also add a null 
terminator to the end of the buffer to ensure that it is a valid C string.

## C++20

C++20 provides several mechanisms to prevent CWE-120, such as `std::string` and `std::vector`. 
These classes automatically manage memory allocation and deallocation, preventing buffer overflow 
and memory corruption.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::string str = "Hello, world!";
    std::vector<char> buffer(str.begin(), str.end());
    buffer.push_back('\0');
    std::cout << &buffer[0] << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we use `std::string` to store the string `str`. We then use `std::vector` to 
create a buffer and copy the characters from `str` to the buffer. We add a null terminator to the 
end of the buffer to ensure that it is a valid C string. We can access the buffer using the 
`&buffer[0]` syntax.

## Rust

Rust provides several mechanisms to prevent CWE-120, such as `String` and `Vec`. These types 
automatically manage memory allocation and deallocation, preventing buffer overflow and memory 
corruption. Rust also provides a safe alternative to C-style strings, called `str`.

```rust
fn main() {
    let str = "Hello, world!".to_string();
    let buffer = str.into_bytes();
    println!("{}", std::str::from_utf8(&buffer).unwrap());
}
```

In this example, we use the `to_string()` method to create a `String` from the string `str`. We 
then use the `into_bytes()` method to convert the `String` to a `Vec<u8>`. We can convert the 
`Vec<u8>` back to a string using the `std::str::from_utf8()` method.

## Conclusion

C17 provides some functions that can be used to mitigate the risk of buffer overflow, but they 
require careful use and can be error-prone. C++20 and Rust provide safer alternatives that 
automatically manage memory allocation and deallocation, preventing buffer overflow and memory 
corruption. Rust also provides a safe alternative to C-style strings, called `str`. When writing 
code that deals with memory allocation and manipulation, it is recommended to use these safer 
alternatives to prevent CWE-120.
