# CWE-190: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-190 is a common weakness in C and C++ programming languages that involves the use of a format 
string that is not properly validated. This can lead to security vulnerabilities such as buffer 
overflows, denial of service attacks, and remote code execution.

## C17

In C17, the CWE-190 can be mitigated by using the `printf` family of functions with proper format 
string validation. This involves using the `%n` format specifier to determine the number of 
characters written to the output buffer and comparing it to the expected length.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char buffer[100];
    int length = 10;
    int written = snprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), "%.*s", length, "Hello, world!");
    if (written < 0 || written >= sizeof(buffer)) {
        // handle error
    }
    if (written != length) {
        // handle error
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we use the `snprintf` function to write a formatted string to the `buffer` array 
with a maximum length of `sizeof(buffer)`. We use the `%.*s` format specifier to limit the number 
of characters written to `length`. We then check the return value of `snprintf` to ensure that no 
errors occurred and that the number of characters written matches the expected length.

## C++20

In C++20, the CWE-190 can be eradicated by using the `std::format` function, which provides a 
type-safe and extensible way to format strings. This function automatically validates the format 
string and ensures that the arguments match the expected types.

```cpp
#include <format>

int main() {
    std::string message = std::format("Hello, {}!", "world");
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we use the `std::format` function to create a formatted string with the value 
`"Hello, world!"`. The function automatically validates the format string and ensures that the 
argument is a string literal.

## Rust

In Rust, the CWE-190 can be mitigated by using the `format!` macro, which provides a type-safe and 
extensible way to format strings. This macro automatically validates the format string and ensures 
that the arguments match the expected types.

```rust
fn main() {
    let message = format!("Hello, {}!", "world");
}
```

In this example, we use the `format!` macro to create a formatted string with the value `"Hello, 
world!"`. The macro automatically validates the format string and ensures that the argument is a 
string literal.

## Conclusion

In summary, the CWE-190 can be mitigated in C17 by using proper format string validation, 
eradicated in C++20 by using the `std::format` function, and mitigated in Rust by using the 
`format!` macro. These modern features provide a type-safe and extensible way to format strings, 
which eliminates the need for manual validation and reduces the risk of security vulnerabilities.
