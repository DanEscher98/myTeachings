# CWE-943: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-943 is a Common Weakness Enumeration that refers to the use of uninitialized memory. This can 
lead to undefined behavior, security vulnerabilities, and crashes. In this article, we will compare 
how C17, C++20, and Rust handle this issue idiomatically.

## C17

In C17, uninitialized memory is a common issue. The language does not provide any built-in 
mechanisms to prevent it. However, there are some coding patterns that can help mitigate the issue. 
One of them is to always initialize variables before using them.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x = 0; // initialize variable
    printf("%d\n", x);
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we initialize the variable `x` before using it. This ensures that the memory is 
properly initialized and avoids any undefined behavior.

## C++20

In C++20, uninitialized memory is also a common issue. However, the language provides some built-in 
mechanisms to prevent it. One of them is the use of default initialization.

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int x{}; // default initialization
    std::cout << x << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we use default initialization to initialize the variable `x`. This ensures that 
the memory is properly initialized and avoids any undefined behavior.

## Rust

In Rust, uninitialized memory is not an issue. The language provides a built-in mechanism to 
prevent it: ownership and borrowing. When a variable is created, it is automatically initialized 
and assigned ownership. The ownership can then be transferred or borrowed, ensuring that the memory 
is always properly initialized.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 0; // initialize variable
    println!("{}", x);
}
```

In this example, we create a variable `x` and initialize it with the value `0`. The ownership of 
the variable is automatically assigned to the current scope, ensuring that the memory is properly 
initialized.

## Conclusion

In summary, C17 and C++20 require the programmer to take extra care to ensure that uninitialized 
memory is not used. C17 relies on coding patterns, while C++20 provides some built-in mechanisms. 
Rust, on the other hand, provides a built-in mechanism that ensures that uninitialized memory is 
not an issue.
