# CWE-415: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-415 is a type of double-free vulnerability that occurs when a program frees the same memory 
address twice. This can lead to memory corruption and potentially allow an attacker to execute 
arbitrary code. In this article, we will discuss how C17, C++20, and Rust handle this vulnerability 
idiomatically.

## C17

C17 does not provide any built-in protection against CWE-415. It is up to the programmer to ensure 
that memory is not freed twice. One way to mitigate this vulnerability is to set the pointer to 
NULL after freeing it. This way, if the pointer is accidentally freed again, the program will crash 
instead of causing memory corruption.

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int* ptr = malloc(sizeof(int));
    free(ptr);
    ptr = NULL; // set pointer to NULL after freeing
    free(ptr); // this will crash the program
    return 0;
}
```

## C++20

C++20 introduces the `std::unique_ptr` class, which provides automatic memory management and 
prevents double-free vulnerabilities. When a `std::unique_ptr` goes out of scope, it automatically 
frees the memory it owns. Additionally, `std::unique_ptr` cannot be copied, preventing multiple 
pointers from owning the same memory.

```c++
#include <memory>

int main() {
    std::unique_ptr<int> ptr = std::make_unique<int>();
    // no need to free the memory manually
    return 0;
}
```

## Rust

Rust's ownership and borrowing system prevents CWE-415 by ensuring that memory is freed exactly 
once. When a variable goes out of scope, Rust automatically frees the memory it owns. Additionally, 
Rust's borrow checker prevents multiple mutable references to the same memory, preventing 
accidental double-free vulnerabilities.

```rust
fn main() {
    let ptr = Box::new(0);
    // no need to free the memory manually
}
```

## Conclusion

C17 requires manual memory management and is prone to CWE-415 vulnerabilities. C++20's 
`std::unique_ptr` provides automatic memory management and prevents double-free vulnerabilities. 
Rust's ownership and borrowing system ensures that memory is freed exactly once and prevents 
accidental double-free vulnerabilities. When it comes to handling CWE-415, Rust provides the most 
idiomatic and safe solution.
