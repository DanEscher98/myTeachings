# CWE-125: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-125 is a security vulnerability that occurs when a user provides input that is longer than the 
expected buffer size, causing a buffer overflow. This can lead to arbitrary code execution, denial 
of service, or other security issues.

## C17

In C17, buffer overflows are a common issue due to the lack of built-in safety features. However, 
there are some ways to mitigate the risk of CWE-125.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    char input[20];
    fgets(input, 20, stdin);
    strncpy(buffer, input, 10);
    buffer[9] = '\0';
    printf("%s\n", buffer);
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we use `strncpy` to copy the input into the buffer, limiting the number of 
characters copied to the size of the buffer. We also add a null terminator to ensure that the 
string is properly terminated.

## C++20

C++20 introduces several new features that can help prevent buffer overflows, such as `std::span` 
and `std::string_view`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <span>

int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    char input[20];
    std::cin.getline(input, 20);
    std::span<char> span(buffer, 10);
    std::copy_n(input, std::min(10ul, std::size(input)), span.begin());
    std::cout << buffer << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we use `std::span` to create a view of the buffer, limiting its size to 10. We 
then use `std::copy_n` to copy the input into the buffer, limiting the number of characters copied 
to the minimum of 10 and the size of the input.

## Rust

Rust is designed with memory safety in mind, and provides several features to prevent buffer 
overflows, such as bounds checking and ownership.

```rust
use std::io::{self, BufRead};

fn main() {
    let mut buffer = [0u8; 10];
    let stdin = io::stdin();
    let input = stdin.lock().lines().next().unwrap().unwrap();
    let input = input.as_bytes();
    buffer[..input.len().min(10)].copy_from_slice(&input[..input.len().min(10)]);
    println!("{}", String::from_utf8_lossy(&buffer));
}
```

In this example, we use a fixed-size array to represent the buffer, and limit its size to 10. We 
then use `copy_from_slice` to copy the input into the buffer, limiting the number of bytes copied 
to the minimum of 10 and the size of the input. Rust's ownership system ensures that the buffer is 
not accessed outside of its scope.

## Conclusion

C17 lacks built-in safety features to prevent buffer overflows, but they can be mitigated with 
careful programming. C++20 introduces new features that can help prevent buffer overflows, but they 
require explicit use. Rust's ownership system and bounds checking provide strong protection against 
buffer overflows by default.
