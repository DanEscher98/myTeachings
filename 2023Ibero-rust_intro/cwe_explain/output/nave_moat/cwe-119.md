# CWE-119: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-119 is a common weakness in software development that involves buffer overflow or buffer 
over-read. This can lead to security vulnerabilities and crashes in the software. In this article, 
we will discuss how C17, C++20, and Rust handle CWE-119 idiomatically.

## C17

C17 is a low-level programming language that is prone to CWE-119. However, with proper coding 
practices, CWE-119 can be mitigated. One way to do this is by using the `fgets()` function instead 
of `gets()`. The `fgets()` function reads a line of text from the input stream and stores it in a 
buffer. It also limits the number of characters that can be read, preventing buffer overflow.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    fgets(buffer, 10, stdin); // read up to 10 characters from stdin
    printf("%s", buffer);
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we use `fgets()` to read up to 10 characters from the standard input stream and 
store them in the `buffer` array. The `printf()` function is then used to print the contents of the 
buffer.

## C++20

C++20 is a modern version of C++ that includes features to mitigate CWE-119. One such feature is 
the `std::string` class, which automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation. This 
eliminates the need for manual memory management and reduces the risk of buffer overflow.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string str;
    std::cin >> str; // read input into str
    std::cout << str;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we use the `std::string` class to store the input from the standard input stream. 
The `cin` object is used to read the input into the `str` object, and the `cout` object is used to 
print the contents of the `str` object.

## Rust

Rust is a modern systems programming language that is designed to prevent CWE-119 and other 
memory-related vulnerabilities. Rust uses a system of ownership and borrowing to ensure that memory 
is managed safely and efficiently.

```rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    let mut buffer = String::new();
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut buffer).expect("Failed to read line");
    print!("{}", buffer);
}
```

In this example, we use the `String` type to store the input from the standard input stream. The 
`read_line()` method is used to read the input into the `buffer` variable, and the `print!()` macro 
is used to print the contents of the `buffer` variable.

## Conclusion

CWE-119 is a common weakness in software development that can lead to security vulnerabilities and 
crashes. C17, C++20, and Rust all provide ways to mitigate CWE-119, but Rust is designed to prevent 
it from happening in the first place. By using modern features and proper coding practices, CWE-119 
can be eradicated or mitigated in all three languages.
