# CWE-126: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-126 is a vulnerability that occurs when a program uses a buffer that is not large enough to 
hold the data it is trying to store. This can lead to buffer overflows, which can be exploited by 
attackers to execute arbitrary code or crash the program.

## C17

In C17, the standard library provides functions like `strcpy` and `strcat` that do not perform 
bounds checking on the destination buffer. This means that if the source string is too long, it 
will overflow the destination buffer, causing undefined behavior.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char dest[10];
    char src[] = "This is a very long string";

    strcpy(dest, src); // buffer overflow!

    printf("%s\n", dest);

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `strcpy` function is used to copy the contents of `src` into `dest`, which has 
a size of only 10 bytes. Since `src` is longer than 10 bytes, the `strcpy` function will write past 
the end of `dest`, causing a buffer overflow.

## C++20

In C++20, the standard library provides a safer alternative to `strcpy` and `strcat` called 
`std::string`. `std::string` automatically manages the memory for the string and performs bounds 
checking to prevent buffer overflows.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string dest = "Hello";
    std::string src = "This is a very long string";

    dest = src; // no buffer overflow!

    std::cout << dest << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `std::string` is used to store the contents of `src` and `dest`. Since 
`std::string` automatically manages the memory for the string, there is no need to worry about 
buffer overflows.

## Rust

In Rust, the standard library provides a type called `String` that is similar to `std::string` in 
C++. `String` automatically manages the memory for the string and performs bounds checking to 
prevent buffer overflows.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut dest = String::from("Hello");
    let src = String::from("This is a very long string");

    dest = src; // no buffer overflow!

    println!("{}", dest);
}
```

In this example, `String` is used to store the contents of `src` and `dest`. Since `String` 
automatically manages the memory for the string, there is no need to worry about buffer overflows.

## Conclusion

C17 provides functions that can lead to buffer overflows if not used carefully. C++20 and Rust 
provide safer alternatives that automatically manage memory and perform bounds checking to prevent 
buffer overflows. When writing code in C17, it is important to be careful when using functions like 
`strcpy` and `strcat` to avoid buffer overflows. In C++20 and Rust, it is recommended to use 
`std::string` and `String`, respectively, to avoid buffer overflows.
