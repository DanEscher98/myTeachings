# CWE-502: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-502 is a weakness that occurs when a function does not properly restrict the size of a buffer, 
which can lead to a buffer overflow. In this scenario, we will compare how C17, C++20, and Rust 
handle this CWE idiomatically.

## C17

C17 does not have any built-in features to handle CWE-502. However, it is possible to mitigate the 
issue by using the `strncpy()` function to copy a string to a buffer with a specified size. This 
function ensures that the buffer is not overflowed.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    char* str = "Hello, world!";
    strncpy(buffer, str, sizeof(buffer));
    buffer[sizeof(buffer) - 1] = '\0';
    printf("%s\n", buffer);
    return 0;
}
```

## C++20

C++20 introduces the `std::span` class, which provides a view over a contiguous sequence of 
objects. This class can be used to prevent buffer overflows by specifying the size of the buffer.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <span>

int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    std::span<char> span(buffer);
    std::string str = "Hello, world!";
    std::copy_n(str.begin(), std::min(str.size(), span.size()), span.begin());
    std::cout << buffer << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Rust

Rust has built-in features to prevent buffer overflows. The `std::slice::from_raw_parts_mut()` 
function can be used to create a mutable slice from a raw pointer and a length. This function 
ensures that the slice is not larger than the buffer.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut buffer: [u8; 10] = [0; 10];
    let str = "Hello, world!";
    let len = std::cmp::min(str.len(), buffer.len());
    let slice = &mut buffer[..len];
    slice.copy_from_slice(str.as_bytes());
    println!("{}", std::str::from_utf8(slice).unwrap());
}
```

## Conclusion

C17 can mitigate CWE-502 by using `strncpy()`, but it requires manual size management. C++20 
provides a safer alternative with `std::span`, which ensures that the buffer is not overflowed. 
Rust has built-in features to prevent buffer overflows, making it the safest option. However, it 
requires more verbose code due to its ownership and borrowing system.
