# CWE-416: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-416 is a common programming mistake that occurs when a programmer allocates memory for a 
variable but forgets to free it. This can lead to memory leaks and other issues. In this article, 
we will discuss how C17, C++20, and Rust handle this issue idiomatically.

## C17

In C17, memory management is left entirely up to the programmer. There are no built-in features to 
help prevent memory leaks or other issues. However, there are some best practices that can be 
followed to mitigate the risk of CWE-416.

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int *ptr = malloc(sizeof(int)); // allocate memory
    if (ptr == NULL) {
        return 1; // handle allocation failure
    }
    // use ptr
    free(ptr); // free memory
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we allocate memory using `malloc()` and check for allocation failure. We then use 
the allocated memory and free it when we are done. This is a simple example, but it demonstrates 
the basic principles of memory management in C.

## C++20

In C++20, we have access to smart pointers, which can help prevent memory leaks and other issues. 
Smart pointers automatically manage memory allocation and deallocation, making it easier to write 
safe and reliable code.

```cpp
#include <memory>

int main() {
    std::unique_ptr<int> ptr = std::make_unique<int>(); // allocate memory
    // use ptr
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we use `std::unique_ptr` to allocate memory and automatically manage its 
deallocation. We also use `std::make_unique` to ensure that memory is allocated safely. This is a 
much safer and more reliable way to manage memory in C++.

## Rust

In Rust, memory management is handled by the compiler. Rust uses a system of ownership and 
borrowing to ensure that memory is managed safely and efficiently. This makes it much harder to 
make mistakes like CWE-416.

```rust
fn main() {
    let ptr = Box::new(0); // allocate memory
    // use ptr
}
```

In this example, we use `Box::new` to allocate memory and automatically manage its deallocation. 
Rust's ownership and borrowing system ensures that memory is managed safely and efficiently, making 
it much harder to make mistakes like CWE-416.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, C17, C++20, and Rust all handle CWE-416 in different ways. C17 relies entirely on 
the programmer to manage memory, while C++20 provides smart pointers to help prevent memory leaks 
and other issues. Rust uses a system of ownership and borrowing to ensure that memory is managed 
safely and efficiently. While all three languages have their strengths and weaknesses, Rust's 
approach to memory management is arguably the safest and most reliable.
