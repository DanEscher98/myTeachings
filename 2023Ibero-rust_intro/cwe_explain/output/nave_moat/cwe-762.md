# CWE-762: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-762 is a vulnerability related to the use of uninitialized memory. It occurs when a program 
uses uninitialized memory to perform operations, which can lead to unexpected behavior and security 
issues.

## C17

In C17, uninitialized memory is a common issue due to the lack of automatic initialization of 
variables. To mitigate this issue, developers must manually initialize variables before using them.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x; // uninitialized variable
    printf("%d\n", x); // undefined behavior
    x = 10; // initialize variable
    printf("%d\n", x); // prints 10
    return 0;
}
```

## C++20

C++20 introduces the concept of initialization patterns, which allows developers to initialize 
variables in a more concise and readable way. This feature helps to mitigate the CWE-762 
vulnerability.

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int x{}; // initialize variable with default value
    std::cout << x << std::endl; // prints 0
    return 0;
}
```

## Rust

Rust is a memory-safe language that prevents the use of uninitialized memory through its ownership 
and borrowing system. This feature ensures that all variables are initialized before use, 
mitigating the CWE-762 vulnerability.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: i32; // uninitialized variable
    println!("{}", x); // compile-time error
    let x = 10; // initialize variable
    println!("{}", x); // prints 10
}
```

## Conclusion

C17 requires manual initialization of variables to mitigate the CWE-762 vulnerability. C++20 
introduces initialization patterns to make initialization more concise and readable. Rust's 
ownership and borrowing system ensures that all variables are initialized before use, making it a 
memory-safe language.
