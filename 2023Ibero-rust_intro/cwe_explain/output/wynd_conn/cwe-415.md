# CWE-415: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-415 is a type of double-free vulnerability that occurs when a program frees the same memory 
address twice. This can lead to memory corruption and potentially allow an attacker to execute 
arbitrary code. In this comparison, we will examine how C17, C++20, and Rust handle this 
vulnerability idiomatically.

## C17

In C17, there is no built-in protection against CWE-415. Programmers must manually track which 
memory addresses have been freed and ensure they are not freed again. This can be error-prone and 
difficult to manage in large codebases.

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
  int* ptr = malloc(sizeof(int));
  free(ptr);
  free(ptr); // CWE-415: double-free vulnerability
  return 0;
}
```

In this example, we allocate memory for an integer and then free it twice. This will result in 
undefined behavior and could potentially crash the program.

## C++20

C++20 introduces the `std::unique_ptr` class, which provides automatic memory management and helps 
prevent CWE-415. When a `std::unique_ptr` goes out of scope, it automatically frees the memory it 
owns. Additionally, `std::unique_ptr` cannot be copied or assigned, which helps prevent accidental 
double-frees.

```cpp
#include <memory>

int main() {
  std::unique_ptr<int> ptr = std::make_unique<int>();
  std::unique_ptr<int> ptr2 = std::move(ptr); // ownership transferred
  std::unique_ptr<int> ptr3 = std::move(ptr); // compile error: unique_ptr cannot be copied
  return 0;
}
```

In this example, we allocate memory for an integer using `std::make_unique`. We then transfer 
ownership of the pointer to `ptr2` using `std::move`. Attempting to copy `ptr` to `ptr3` will 
result in a compile error, preventing accidental double-frees.

## Rust

Rust's ownership and borrowing system helps prevent CWE-415 by ensuring that memory is only freed 
once. When a variable goes out of scope, Rust automatically frees the memory it owns. Additionally, 
Rust's borrow checker prevents multiple mutable references to the same memory address, which helps 
prevent accidental double-frees.

```rust
fn main() {
  let mut ptr = Box::new(0);
  let ptr2 = &mut ptr; // mutable reference to ptr
  let ptr3 = &mut ptr; // compile error: cannot have multiple mutable references to ptr
}
```

In this example, we allocate memory for an integer using `Box::new`. We then create a mutable 
reference to `ptr` using `&mut ptr2`. Attempting to create another mutable reference to `ptr` using 
`&mut ptr3` will result in a compile error, preventing accidental double-frees.

## Conclusion

C17 provides no built-in protection against CWE-415, while C++20 and Rust both provide idiomatic 
solutions to prevent double-frees. C++20's `std::unique_ptr` class provides automatic memory 
management and prevents accidental double-frees through ownership transfer and non-copyability. 
Rust's ownership and borrowing system prevents multiple mutable references to the same memory 
address, ensuring that memory is only freed once.
