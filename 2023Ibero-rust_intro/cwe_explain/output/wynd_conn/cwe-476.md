# CWE-476: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-476 is a common weakness in C and C++ programming languages that involves the use of strcpy() 
and strcat() functions without proper bounds checking, leading to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. 
Rust, being a memory-safe language, does not have this issue. In this article, we will discuss how 
C17 and C++20 handle CWE-476 and compare it with Rust.

## C17

In C17, the strcpy() and strcat() functions are still present, and they can still be used in the 
same way as before. However, the standard library now provides a safer alternative, strncpy() and 
strncat(), which take an additional argument specifying the maximum number of characters to copy or 
concatenate. This helps prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities, but it is still up to the 
programmer to use these functions correctly.

```c
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char dest[10] = "hello";
    char src[] = "world";
    strncpy(dest, src, sizeof(dest) - strlen(dest) - 1);
    dest[sizeof(dest) - 1] = '\0';
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we use strncpy() to copy the contents of src into dest, ensuring that we do not 
exceed the size of dest. We also add a null terminator to dest to ensure that it is a valid C 
string.

## C++20

C++20 introduces the std::string_view class, which provides a safe way to manipulate strings 
without the risk of buffer overflow vulnerabilities. std::string_view is a lightweight object that 
represents a view into a sequence of characters, and it can be used to pass strings to functions 
without making a copy.

```c++
#include <string_view>

void print(std::string_view str) {
    std::cout << str << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    char buffer[10] = "hello";
    std::string_view str(buffer, 5);
    print(str);
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we create a std::string_view object that points to the first 5 characters of 
buffer. We then pass this object to the print() function, which prints the string to the console. 
Because std::string_view does not make a copy of the string, there is no risk of buffer overflow 
vulnerabilities.

## Rust

Rust is a memory-safe language that prevents buffer overflow vulnerabilities by enforcing strict 
ownership and borrowing rules. In Rust, strings are represented by the String type, which is a 
growable, heap-allocated string. Rust also provides the &str type, which is a borrowed string slice 
that points to a sequence of characters.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = "world";
    s.push_str(s2);
    println!("{}", s);
}
```

In this example, we create a String object s and a string slice s2. We then use the push_str() 
method to append s2 to s, which grows the size of the string as needed. Because Rust enforces 
strict ownership and borrowing rules, there is no risk of buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion

C17 and C++20 provide safer alternatives to the strcpy() and strcat() functions, but it is still up 
to the programmer to use them correctly. Rust, on the other hand, prevents buffer overflow 
vulnerabilities by enforcing strict ownership and borrowing rules. While C and C++ provide more 
control over memory management, they also require more careful attention to avoid CWE-476 
vulnerabilities. Rust, on the other hand, provides a safer and more ergonomic way to handle strings 
without sacrificing performance.
