# CWE-125: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-125 is a security vulnerability that occurs when a buffer is not properly checked for 
boundaries, leading to buffer overflow attacks. In this article, we will discuss how C17, C++20, 
and Rust handle this vulnerability idiomatically.

## C17

C17 is a low-level programming language that provides direct access to memory, making it 
susceptible to buffer overflow attacks. However, C17 provides several functions to mitigate this 
vulnerability, such as `strncpy()` and `strncat()`, which allow the programmer to specify the 
maximum number of characters to copy or concatenate.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    char source[] = "This is a long string";
    strncpy(buffer, source, sizeof(buffer) - 1);
    buffer[sizeof(buffer) - 1] = '\0';
    printf("%s\n", buffer);
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we use `strncpy()` to copy the contents of `source` into `buffer`, ensuring that 
we do not exceed the size of `buffer`.

## C++20

C++20 provides several features to mitigate buffer overflow attacks, such as `std::string_view` and 
`std::span`. `std::string_view` provides a read-only view of a string, while `std::span` provides a 
view of a contiguous sequence of objects.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string_view>

int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    std::string_view source = "This is a long string";
    std::span<char> span(buffer, sizeof(buffer));
    std::copy_n(source.begin(), span.size() - 1, span.begin());
    span[span.size() - 1] = '\0';
    std::cout << buffer << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we use `std::span` to create a view of `buffer`, and `std::copy_n()` to copy the 
contents of `source` into `buffer`, ensuring that we do not exceed the size of `buffer`.

## Rust

Rust is a systems programming language that provides memory safety guarantees, making it immune to 
buffer overflow attacks. Rust achieves this by enforcing strict ownership and borrowing rules, and 
by providing safe abstractions for working with memory, such as slices.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut buffer = [0; 10];
    let source = "This is a long string";
    let bytes = source.as_bytes();
    buffer[..bytes.len()].copy_from_slice(bytes);
    println!("{}", std::str::from_utf8(&buffer).unwrap());
}
```

In this example, we use a fixed-size array to create `buffer`, and `copy_from_slice()` to copy the 
contents of `source` into `buffer`, ensuring that we do not exceed the size of `buffer`.

## Conclusion

C17, C++20, and Rust provide different approaches to mitigate the CWE-125 vulnerability. While C17 
and C++20 rely on functions and abstractions to ensure memory safety, Rust provides memory safety 
guarantees through its ownership and borrowing rules. It is important to choose the right tool for 
the job, and to use modern features to mitigate security vulnerabilities.
