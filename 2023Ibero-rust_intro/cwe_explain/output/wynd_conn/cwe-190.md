# CWE-190: C17 vs C++20 vs Rust

CWE-190 is a Common Weakness Enumeration category that refers to integer overflow or wraparound 
vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities occur when an integer value is incremented or decremented 
beyond its maximum or minimum value, causing it to wrap around to the opposite end of the range. 
This can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities in software.

## C17

In C17, integer overflow is not handled natively, and it is up to the programmer to ensure that 
integer values do not overflow. This can be done by checking the range of values before performing 
arithmetic operations or by using larger integer types.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>

int main() {
    uint32_t a = UINT32_MAX;
    uint32_t b = 1;
    uint32_t c = a + b; // integer overflow

    printf("%u\n", c); // unexpected behavior
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, an unsigned 32-bit integer is incremented beyond its maximum value, causing it to 
wrap around to zero. This can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities in software.

## C++20

In C++20, integer overflow is handled natively through the use of the `std::overflow_error` 
exception. This exception is thrown when an arithmetic operation results in an integer overflow.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdint>
#include <stdexcept>

int main() {
    std::uint32_t a = UINT32_MAX;
    std::uint32_t b = 1;

    try {
        std::uint32_t c = std::add_overflow(a, b);
        std::cout << c << std::endl;
    } catch (std::overflow_error& e) {
        std::cerr << e.what() << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `std::add_overflow` function is used to add two unsigned 32-bit integers. If 
the result of the operation would cause an integer overflow, a `std::overflow_error` exception is 
thrown. This ensures that integer overflow is handled safely and predictably.

## Rust

In Rust, integer overflow is also handled natively through the use of the `panic!` macro. By 
default, Rust will panic if an arithmetic operation results in an integer overflow.

```rust
fn main() {
    let a: u32 = u32::MAX;
    let b: u32 = 1;

    let c = a + b; // integer overflow

    println!("{}", c); // panics
}
```

In this example, an unsigned 32-bit integer is incremented beyond its maximum value, causing it to 
panic. This ensures that integer overflow is handled safely and predictably.

## Conclusion

C17 does not handle integer overflow natively, which can lead to unexpected behavior or security 
vulnerabilities in software. C++20 and Rust both handle integer overflow natively, ensuring that it 
is handled safely and predictably. While Rust's approach may be more strict, it ensures that 
integer overflow is always handled correctly.
